We constructed an F2 mapping population (N = 539) between two distinct populations of Mimulus guttatus. We measured 20 floral, vegetative, and life-history characters on parents and F1 and F2 hybrids in a common garden experiment. We employed multitrait composite interval mapping to determine the number, effect, and degree of pleiotropy in quantitative trait loci (QTL) affecting divergence in floral, vegetative, and life-history characters. We detected 16 QTL affecting floral traits; 7 affecting vegetative traits; and 5 affecting selected floral, vegetative, and life-history traits. Floral and vegetative traits are clearly polygenic. We detected a few major QTL, with all remaining QTL of small effect. Most detected QTL are pleiotropic, implying that the evolutionary shift between these annual and perennial populations is constrained. We also compared the genetic architecture controlling floral trait divergence both within (our intraspecific study) and between species, on the basis of a previously published analysis of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Eleven of our 16 floral QTL map to approximately the same location in the interspecific map based on shared, collinear markers, implying that there may be a shared genetic basis for floral divergence within and among species of Mimulus.",

		"abstract": "The transition to selfing in Capsella rubella accompanies its recent divergence from the ancestral outcrossing C. grandiflora species about 100,000 years ago. Whether the change in mating system was accompanied by the evolution of additional reproductive barriers that enforced species divergence remained unknown. Here, we show that C. rubella and C. grandiflora are reproductively separated by an endosperm-based, non-reciprocal postzygotic hybridization barrier. While hybridizations of C. rubella maternal plants with C. grandiflora pollen donors resulted in complete seed abortion caused by endosperm cellularization failure, the reciprocal hybridization resulted in the formation of small seeds with precociously cellularized endosperm. Strikingly, the transcriptomic response of both hybridizations mimicked respectively the response of paternal and maternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting unbalanced genome strength causes hybridization failure in both species. These results provide strong support for the theory that crosses between plants of different mating systems will be unbalanced, with the outcrosser behaving like a plant of increased ploidy, evoking a response that resembles an interploidy-type seed failure. Seed incompatilibity of C. rubella pollinated by C. grandiflora followed the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, involving negative genetic interaction of multiple paternal C. grandiflora loci with at least one maternal C. rubella locus. Given that both species only recently diverged, our data suggest that a fast evolving mechanism underlies the post-zygotic hybridization barrier(s) separating both species.",

In most angiosperms, the endosperm develops initially as a syncytium to facilitate rapid seed growth. The transition from the syncytial to the cellularized state occurs at a defined time point during seed development. Manipulating the timing of endosperm cellularization through interploidy crosses negatively impacts on embryo growth, suggesting that endosperm cellularization is a critical step during seed development. In this study, we show that failure of endosperm cellularization in fertilization independent seed 2 (fis2) and endosperm defective 1 (ede1) Arabidopsis mutants correlates with impaired embryo development. Restoration of endosperm cellularization in fis2 seeds by reducing expression of the MADS-box gene AGAMOUS-LIKE 62 (AGL62) promotes embryo development, strongly supporting an essential role of endosperm cellularization for viable seed formation. Endosperm cellularization failure in fis2 seeds correlates with increased hexose levels, suggesting that arrest of embryo development is a consequence of failed nutrient translocation to the developing embryo. Finally, we demonstrate that AGL62 is a direct target gene of FIS Polycomb group repressive complex 2 (PRC2), establishing the molecular basis for FIS PRC2-mediated endosperm cellularization.",

		"abstract": "As a common cause of reproductive isolation in diverse taxa, hybrid incompatibilities are fundamentally important to speciation. A key question is which evolutionary forces drive the initial substitutions within species that lead to hybrid dysfunction. Previously, we discovered a simple genetic incompatibility that causes nearly complete male sterility and partial female sterility in hybrids between the two closely related yellow monkeyflower species Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus nasutus. In this report, we fine map the two major incompatibility loci - hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) and hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) - to small nuclear genomic regions (each < 70 kb) that include strong candidate genes. With this improved genetic resolution, we also investigate the evolutionary dynamics of hms1 in a natural population of M. guttatus known to be polymorphic at this locus. Using classical genetic crosses and population genomics, we show that a 320-kb region containing the hms1 incompatibility allele has risen to intermediate frequency in this population by strong natural selection. This finding provides direct evidence that natural selection within plant species can lead to hybrid dysfunction between species.\nCopyright © 2014, The Genetics Society of America.",

		"abstract": "The hypothesis that early flowering plants were insect-pollinated could be tested by an examination of the pollination biology of basal angiosperms and the pollination modes of fossil angiosperms. We provide data to show that early fossil angiosperms were insect-pollinated. Eighty-six percent of 29 extant basal angiosperm families have species that are zoophilous (of which 34% are specialized) and 17% of the families have species that are wind-pollinated, whereas basal eudicot families and basal monocot families more commonly have wind and specialized pollination modes (up to 78%). Character reconstruction based on recent molecular trees of angiosperms suggests that the most parsimonious result is that zoophily is the ancestral state. Combining pollen ornamentation, size, and aperture characteristics and the abundance of single-species pollen clumps of Cenomanian angiosperm-dispersed pollen species from the Dakota Formation demonstrates a dominance of zoophilous pollination (76% versus 24% wind pollination). The zoophilous pollen species have adaptations for pollination by generalist insects (39%), specialized pollen-collecting insects (27%), and other specialized pollinators (10%). These data quantify the presences of more specialized pollination modes during the mid-Cretaceous angiosperm diversification.",

Three separate genera are derived from within the clade that contains all the Mimulus species in western North America. The taxonomic status of the proposed sections of Mimulus and the relationships of many taxonomically difficult species are considered with observations on morphological evolution. Discordance between data sources provides support for the hypothesis that M. evanescens is a hybrid between M. latidens and M. breviflorus. In two major clades (Eunanus and Diplacus), patterns of genetic variation do not match the current taxonomy. The clustering of taxa in Eunanus is strongly associated with geographic distributions. Mimulus aurantiacus sensu Thompson, M. nanus, and M. floribundus are found to be progenitor species to other species that appear to be derived from within them. Polyploidy and aneuploidy events are clustered near the tips of the phylogeny. Thus, these two mechanisms are concluded to have played a relatively small role in the evolution of persistent lineages in Mimulus. The phylogenetic distribution of rare taxa is also examined.",

Often, seeds from interploidy crosses develop differently depending on whether the mother or father contributes more chromosome sets, suggesting that maternal and paternal genomes are not functionally equivalent. Here we present the first cytological investigation of seed development following interploidy crosses in Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that crosses between diploid and tetraploid plants in either direction, resulting in double the normal dose of maternal or paternal genomes in the seed, produce viable seeds containing triploid embryos. However, development of the seed and in particular the endosperm is abnormal, with maternal and paternal genomic excess producing complementary phenotypes. A double dose of maternal genomes with respect to paternal contribution inhibits endosperm development and ultimately produces a smaller embryo. In contrast, a double dose of paternal genomes promotes growth of the endosperm and embryo. Reciprocal crosses between diploids and hexaploids, resulting in a triple dose of maternal or paternal genomes, produce seeds that begin development with similar but more extreme phenotypes than those with a double dose, but these invariably abort. One explanation of our observations is that seeds with maternal or paternal excess contain different doses of maternally or paternally expressed imprinted loci affecting endosperm development.",

		"abstract": "Parental conflicts can lead to antagonistic coevolution of the sexes and of parental genomes. Within a population, the resulting antagonistic effects should balance, but crosses between populations can reveal conflict. Parental conflict is less intense in self‐pollinating plants than in outcrossers because outcrossing plants are pollinated by multiple pollen donors unrelated to the seed parent, while a self‐pollinating plant is primarily pollinated by one individual (itself). Therefore, in crosses between plants with differing mating systems, outcrossing parents are expected to “overpower” selfing parents. We call this the weak inbreeder/strong outbreeder (WISO) hypothesis. Prezygotically, such overpowering can alter pollination success, and we argue that our hypothesis explains a common pattern of unilateral incompatibility, in which pollen from self‐incompatible populations fertilizes ovules of self‐compatible individuals but the reciprocal cross fails. A postzygotic manifestation of overpowering is aberrant seed development due to parent‐of‐origin effects such as genomic imprinting. We evaluate evidence for the WISO hypothesis by reviewing published accounts of crosses between plants of different mating systems. Many, but not all, of such reports support our hypothesis. Since parental conflicts can perturb fertilization and development, such conflicts may strengthen reproductive barriers between populations, contributing to speciation.",

In this study, we pursued two goals. First, we reconstructed the phylogeny of species in Erythranthe using both DNA sequences from the ribosomal DNA ITS and ETS and AFLPs. Data from rDNA sequences support the monophyly of the section, including M. parishii, but provide little support for relationships within it. Analyses using AFLP data resulted in a well-supported hypothesis of relationships among all Erythranthe species. Our second goal was to reconstruct ancestral pollination syndromes and ancestral states of individual characters associated with hummingbird-pollinated flowers. Both parsimony and likelihood approaches indicate that hummingbird pollination evolved twice in Erythranthe from insect-pollinated ancestors. Our reconstruction of individual characters indicates that corolla color and some aspects of corolla shape change states at the same point on the phylogenetic tree as the switch to hummingbird pollination; however, a switch to secretion of high amounts of nectar does not. Floral trait transformation may have been more punctuational than gradual.",

In this time, the M. nasutus genome has accrued genomic signatures of the transition to predominant selfing, including an elevated proportion of nonsynonymous variants, an accumulation of premature stop codons, and extended levels of linkage disequilibrium.

Here, we use illumina transcriptome sequencing and population resequencing to test for changes in polymorphism, base composition, and selection in the selfing angiosperm Collinsia rattanii (Plantaginaceae) compared with its more outcrossing sister species Collinsia linearis. Coalescent analysis indicates intermediate species divergence (500,000–1 million years) with no ongoing gene flow, but also evidence that the C. rattanii clade remains polymorphic for floral morphology and mating system, suggesting either an ongoing shift to selfing or a potential reversal from selfing to outcrossing. We identify a significant reduction in polymorphism in C. rattanii, particularly within populations. Analysis of polymorphisms suggests an elevated ratio of unique nonsynonymous to synonymous polymorphism in C. rattanii, consistent with relaxed selection in selfing lineages. We additionally find higher linkage disequilibrium and differentiation, lower GC content at variable sites, and reduced expression of genes important in pollen production and pollinator attraction in C. rattanii compared with C. linearis. Together, our results highlight the potential for rapid shifts in the efficacy of selection, gene expression and base composition associated with ongoing evolution of selfing.",

In plants, the shift from outcrossing to self-pollination is common, providing the opportunity for comparisons of QTL architecture among parallel evolutionary transitions. We used QTL mapping in hybrids between the bee-pollinated monkeyflower Mimulus lewisii and the closely related selfer Mimulus parishii to determine the genetic basis of divergence in floral traits and flowering time associated with mating-system evolution, and to characterize hybrid anther sterility. We found a moderately polygenic and highly directional basis for floral size evolution, suggesting adaptation from standing variation or in pursuit of a moving optimum, whereas only a few major loci accounted for substantial flowering-time divergence. Cytonuclear incompatibilities caused hybrid anther sterility, confounding estimation of reproductive organ QTLs. The genetic architecture of floral traits associated with selfing in M. parishii was primarily polygenic, as in other QTL studies of this transition, but in contrast to the previously characterized oligogenic basis of a pollinator shift in close relatives. Hybrid anther sterility appeared parallel at the molecular level to previously characterized incompatibilities, but also raised new questions about cytonuclear co-evolution in plants.",

Mimulus lewisii flowers are visited primarily by bumblebees, whereas M. cardinalis flowers are visited mostly by hummingbirds. The genetic control of 12 morphological differences between the flowers of M. lewisii and M. cardinalis was explored in a large linkage mapping population of F2 plants n = 465 to provide an accurate estimate of the number and magnitude of effect of quantitative trait loci (QTLs) governing each character. Between one and six QTLs were identified for each trait. Most (9/12) traits appear to be controlled in part by at least one major QTL explaining >/=25% of the total phenotypic variance.

		"abstract": "Inferences about past processes of adaptation and speciation require a gene-scale and genome-wide understanding of the evolutionary history of diverging taxa. In this study, we use genome-wide capture of nuclear gene sequences, plus skimming of organellar sequences, to investigate the phylogenomics of monkeyflowers in Mimulus section Erythranthe (27 accessions from seven species). Taxa within Erythranthe, particularly the parapatric and putatively sister species M. lewisii (bee-pollinated) and M. cardinalis (hummingbird-pollinated), have been a model system for investigating the ecological genetics of speciation and adaptation for over five decades. Across >8000 nuclear loci, multiple methods resolve a predominant species tree in which M. cardinalis groups with other hummingbird-pollinated taxa (37% of gene trees), rather than being sister to M. lewisii (32% of gene trees). We independently corroborate a single evolution of hummingbird pollination syndrome in Erythranthe by demonstrating functional redundancy in genetic complementation tests of floral traits in hybrids; together, these analyses overturn a textbook case of pollination-syndrome convergence. Strong asymmetries in allele sharing (Patterson’s D-statistic and related tests) indicate that gene tree discordance reflects ancient and recent introgression rather than incomplete lineage sorting. Consistent with abundant introgression blurring the history of divergence, low-recombination and adaptation-associated regions support the new species tree, while high-recombination regions generate phylogenetic evidence for sister status for M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Population-level sampling of core taxa also revealed two instances of chloroplast capture, with Sierran M. lewisii and Southern Californian M. parishii each carrying organelle genomes nested within respective sympatric M. cardinalis clades. A recent organellar transfer from M. cardinalis, an outcrosser where selfish cytonuclear dynamics are more likely, may account for the unexpected cytoplasmic male sterility effects of selfer M. parishii organelles in hybrids with M. lewisii. Overall, our phylogenomic results reveal extensive reticulation throughout the evolutionary history of a classic monkeyflower radiation, suggesting that natural selection (re-)assembles and maintains species-diagnostic traits and barriers in the face of gene flow. Our findings further underline the challenges, even in reproductively isolated species, in distinguishing re-use of adaptive alleles from true convergence and emphasize the value of a phylogenomic framework for reconstructing the evolutionary genetics of adaptation and speciation.",

We review existing methods and empirical studies to identify recent advances in the genomics of hybridization, as well as issues that need to be addressed. Notable progress has been made in the development of methods for detecting hybridization and inferring individual ancestries. However, few approaches reconstruct the magnitude and timing of gene flow, estimate the fitness of hybrids or incorporate knowledge of recombination rate. Empirical studies indicate that the genomic consequences of hybridization are complex, including a highly heterogeneous landscape of differentiation. Inferred characteristics of hybridization differ substantially among species groups. Loci showing unusual patterns – which may contribute to reproductive barriers – are usually scattered throughout the genome, with potential enrichment in sex chromosomes and regions of reduced recombination. We caution against the growing trend of interpreting genomic variation in summary statistics across genomes as evidence of differential gene flow. We argue that converting genomic patterns into useful inferences about hybridization will ultimately require models and methods that directly incorporate key ingredients of speciation, including the dynamic nature of gene flow, selection acting in hybrid populations and recombination rate variation.",

		"abstract": "Genomic conflicts may play a central role in the evolution of reproductive barriers. Theory predicts that early-onset hybrid inviability may stem from conflict between parents for resource allocation to offspring. Here, we describe M. decorus: a group of cryptic species within the M. guttatus species complex that are largely reproductively isolated by hybrid seed inviability (HSI). HSI between M. guttatus and M. decorus is common and strong, but populations of M. decorus vary in the magnitude and directionality of HSI with M. guttatus. Patterns of HSI between M. guttatus and M. decorus, as well as within M. decorus, conform to the predictions of parental conflict: first, reciprocal F1s exhibit size differences and parent-of-origin-specific endosperm defects; second, the extent of asymmetry between reciprocal F1 seed size is correlated with asymmetry in HSI; and third, inferred differences in the extent of conflict predict the extent of HSI between populations. We also find that HSI is rapidly evolving, as populations that exhibit the most HSI are each others' closest relative. Lastly, although all populations appear largely outcrossing, we find that the differences in the inferred strength of conflict scale positively with π, suggesting that demographic or life history factors other than transitions to self-fertilization may influence the rate of parental-conflict-driven evolution. Overall, these patterns suggest the rapid evolution of parent-of-origin-specific resource allocation alleles coincident with HSI within and between M. guttatus and M. decorus. Parental conflict may therefore be an important evolutionary driver of reproductive isolation.",

Corolla tube length often varies dramatically among species and is a major determinant of pollinator preference. However, our understanding of the developmental dynamics underlying corolla tube length variation is very limited. Here we examined corolla tube growth in the Mimulus lewisii species complex, an emerging model system for studying the developmental genetics and evo‐devo of pollinator‐associated floral traits. We compared developmental and cellular processes associated with corolla tube length variation among the bee‐pollinated M. lewisii, the hummingbird‐pollinated Mimulus verbenaceus, and the self‐pollinated Mimulus parishii. We found that in all three species, cell size is non‐uniformly distributed along the mature tube, with the longest cells just distal to the stamen insertion site. Differences in corolla tube length among the three species are not associated with processes of organogenesis or early development but are associated with variation in multiple processes occurring later in development, including the location and duration of cell division and cell elongation. The tube growth curves of the small‐flowered M. parishii and large‐flowered M. lewisii are essentially indistinguishable, except that M. parishii tubes stop growing earlier at a smaller size, suggesting a critical role of heterochrony in the shift from outcrossing to selfing. These results not only highlight the developmental process associated with corolla tube variation among species but also provide a baseline reference for future developmental genetic analyses of mutants or transgenic plants with altered corolla tube morphology in this emerging model system.",

We discuss the factors that influence how effective incompatibilities are in limiting gene flow. (ii)\n              early onset of species boundaries via rapid evolution\n              : intrinsic postzygotic barriers can evolve between recently diverged populations or incipient species, thereby influencing speciation relatively early in the process. We discuss why the early origination of incompatibilities is expected under some biological models, and detail how other (and often less obvious) incompatibilities may also serve as important barriers early on in speciation. (iii)\n              reinforcement\n              : intrinsic postzygotic barriers can promote the evolution of subsequent reproductive isolation through processes such as reinforcement, even between relatively recently diverged species pairs. We incorporate classic and recent empirical and theoretical work to explore these three facets of intrinsic postzygotic barriers, and provide our thoughts on recent challenges and areas in the field in which progress can be made.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Analyses among animal species have found that reproductive isolation increases monotonically with genetic distance, evolves more quickly for prezygotic than postzygotic traits, and is stronger among sympatric than allopatric species pairs. The latter pattern is consistent with expectations under the reinforcement hypothesis. To determine whether similar trends are found among plant species, patterns of reproductive isolation (postpollination prezygotic, postzygotic, and “total” isolation) in three plant genera (Glycine, Silene, Streptanthus) were examined using data from previously published artificial hybridization experiments. In Silene, all measures of reproductive isolation were positively correlated with genetic distance. In contrast, in Glycine and Streptanthus, correlations between reproductive isolation and genetic distance were weak or nonsignificant, possibly due to the influence of biologically unusual taxa, variable evolutionary forces acting in different lineages, or insufficient time to accumulate reproductive isolation. There was no evidence that postpollination prezygotic reproductive isolation evolved faster than postzygotic isolation in Glycine or Silene. We also detected no evidence for faster accumulation of postmating prezygotic isolation between sympatric than allopatric species pairs; thus we found no evidence for the operation of speciation via reinforcement. In Silene, which included six polyploid species, results suggest that changes in ploidy disrupt a simple monotonic relationship between isolation and genetic distance.",

		"abstract": "Speciation results from the progressive accumulation of mutations that decrease the probability of mating between parental populations or reduce the fitness of hybrids—the so-called species barriers. The speciation genomic literature, however, is mainly a collection of case studies, each with its own approach and specificities, such that a global view of the gradual process of evolution from one to two species is currently lacking. Of primary importance is the prevalence of gene flow between diverging entities, which is central in most species concepts and has been widely discussed in recent years. Here, we explore the continuum of speciation thanks to a comparative analysis of genomic data from 61 pairs of populations/species of animals with variable levels of divergence. Gene flow between diverging gene pools is assessed under an approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) framework. We show that the intermediate \"grey zone\" of speciation, in which taxonomy is often controversial, spans from 0.5% to 2% of net synonymous divergence, irrespective of species life history traits or ecology. Thanks to appropriate modeling of among-locus variation in genetic drift and introgression rate, we clarify the status of the majority of ambiguous cases and uncover a number of cryptic species. Our analysis also reveals the high incidence in animals of semi-isolated species (when some but not all loci are affected by barriers to gene flow) and highlights the intrinsic difficulty, both statistical and conceptual, of delineating species in the grey zone of speciation.",

		"abstract": "Since Darwin published the “Origin,” great progress has been made in our understanding of speciation mechanisms. The early investigations by Mayr and Dobzhansky linked Darwin's view of speciation by adaptive divergence to the evolution of reproductive isolation, and thus provided a framework for studying the origin of species. However, major controversies and questions remain, including: When is speciation nonecological? Under what conditions does geographic isolation constitute a reproductive isolating barrier? and How do we estimate the “importance” of different isolating barriers? Here, we address these questions, providing historical background and offering some new perspectives. A topic of great recent interest is the role of ecology in speciation. “Ecological speciation” is defined as the case in which divergent selection leads to reproductive isolation, with speciation under uniform selection, polyploid speciation, and speciation by genetic drift defined as “nonecological.” We review these proposed cases of nonecological speciation and conclude that speciation by uniform selection and polyploidy normally involve ecological processes. Furthermore, because selection can impart reproductive isolation both directly through traits under selection and indirectly through pleiotropy and linkage, it is much more effective in producing isolation than genetic drift. We thus argue that natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation, and given the many ways in which stochastic and deterministic factors may interact during divergence, we question whether the ecological speciation concept is useful. We also suggest that geographic isolation caused by adaptation to different habitats plays a major, and largely neglected, role in speciation. We thus provide a framework for incorporating geographic isolation into the biological species concept (BSC) by separating ecological from historical processes that govern species distributions, allowing for an estimate of geographic isolation based upon genetic differences between taxa. Finally, we suggest that the individual and relative contributions of all potential barriers be estimated for species pairs that have recently achieved species status under the criteria of the BSC. Only in this way will it be possible to distinguish those barriers that have actually contributed to speciation from those that have accumulated after speciation is complete. We conclude that ecological adaptation is the major driver of reproductive isolation, and that the term “biology of speciation,” as proposed by Mayr, remains an accurate and useful characterization of the diversity of speciation mechanisms.",

A large class of phylogenomic methods makes use of data from one sample per species to infer introgression based on expectations from the multispecies coalescent. These methods range from simple tests, such as the D-statistic, to model-based approaches for inferring phylogenetic networks. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the various signals that different modes of introgression are expected leave in the genome, and how current methods are designed to detect them. We discuss the strengths and pitfalls of these approaches and identify areas for future development, highlighting the different signals of introgression and the power of each method to detect them.

		"abstract": "Speciation genomic studies aim to interpret patterns of genome-wide variation in light of the processes that give rise to new species. However, interpreting the genomic “landscape” of speciation is difficult, because many evolutionary processes can impact levels of variation. Facilitated by the first chromosome-level assembly for the group, we use whole-genome sequencing and simulations to shed light on the processes that have shaped the genomic landscape during a radiation of monkeyflowers. After inferring the phylogenetic relationships among the 9 taxa in this radiation, we show that highly similar diversity (π) and differentiation (FST) landscapes have emerged across the group. Variation in these landscapes was strongly predicted by the local density of functional elements and the recombination rate, suggesting that the landscapes have been shaped by widespread natural selection. Using the varying divergence times between pairs of taxa, we show that the correlations between FST and genome features arose almost immediately after a population split and have become stronger over time. Simulations of genomic landscape evolution suggest that background selection (BGS; i.e., selection against deleterious mutations) alone is too subtle to generate the observed patterns, but scenarios that involve positive selection and genetic incompatibilities are plausible alternative explanations. Finally, tests for introgression among these taxa reveal widespread evidence of heterogeneous selection against gene flow during this radiation. Combined with previous evidence for adaptation in this system, we conclude that the correlation in FST among these taxa informs us about the processes contributing to adaptation and speciation during a rapid radiation.",

Negative epistatic interactions between genes from different parental genomes decrease the fitness of hybrids and can limit gene flow between species. However, little is known about the number and genome-wide distribution of genetic incompatibilities separating species. To detect interacting genes, we perform a high-resolution genome scan for linkage disequilibrium between unlinked genomic regions in naturally occurring hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We estimate that hundreds of pairs of genomic regions contribute to reproductive isolation between these species, despite them being recently diverged. Many of these incompatibilities are likely the result of natural or sexual selection on hybrids, since intrinsic isolation is known to be weak. Patterns of genomic divergence at these regions imply that genetic incompatibilities play a significant role in limiting gene flow even in young species.",

We intercrossed two closely related species of monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus and Mimulus tilingii, to characterize the mechanisms and strength of postzygotic reproductive isolation. Then, using a reciprocal backcross design, we performed high-resolution genetic mapping to determine the genetic architecture of hybrid seed lethality and directly test for loci with parent-of-origin effects. We found that F1 hybrid seed lethality is an exceptionally strong isolating barrier between Mimulus species, with reciprocal crosses producing < 1% viable seeds. This form of postzygotic reproductive isolation appears to be highly polygenic, indicating that multiple incompatibility loci have accumulated rapidly between these closely related Mimulus species. It is also primarily caused by genetic loci with parent-of-origin effects, suggesting a possible role for imprinted genes in the evolution of Mimulus hybrid seed lethality. Our findings suggest that divergence in loci with parent-of-origin effects, which is probably driven by genomic coevolution within lineages, might be an important source of hybrid incompatibilities between flowering plant species.",

The main reason was that the traits of interest in livestock production were much more complex than expected: they were determined by thousands of genes with small effects on phenotype. These effects were usually too small to be statistically significant and so were ignored.Genomic selection (GS) assumes that all markers might be linked to a gene affecting the trait and concentrates on estimating their effect rather than testing its significance. Three technological breakthroughs resulted in the current wide-spread use of DNA information in animal breeding: the development of the genomic selection technology, the discovery of massive numbers of genetic markers (single nucleotide polymorphisms; SNPs), and high-throughput technology to genotype animals for (hundreds of) thousands of SNPs in a cost-effective manner.Here we review current methods for GS, including how they deal with practical data, where genotypes are missing on a large scale. The use of whole-genome sequence data is anticipated, and its advantages and disadvantages are depicted. Current and predicted future impacts of GS on dairy and beef cattle, pigs, and poultry breeding are described. Finally, future directions for GS are discussed.It is anticipated that future GS applications will either be: within breed (wbGS), where accuracy is obtained by maintaining huge within-breed reference populations; or across breed (abGS) where accuracy is obtained from across-breed reference populations and high-density GS methods that focus on causative genomic regions. We argue that future GS applications will increasingly turn toward abGS.",

The collection of suitable datasets can take many years and disentangling the contributions of the environment and genetics to phenotypic change is not trivial. Furthermore, pedigree-based methods of obtaining individual breeding values have known biases. Here, we apply a genomic prediction approach to estimate breeding values of adult weight in a 35-year dataset of Soay sheep (<i>Ovis aries</i>). During the study period adult body weight decreased, but the underlying genetic component of body weight increased, at a rate that is unlikely to be attributable to genetic drift. Thus cryptic microevolution of greater adult body weight has probably occurred. Using genomic prediction to study microevolution in wild populations can remove the requirement for pedigree data, potentially opening up new study systems for similar research.</p>",

		"abstract": "The use of genetic variation (DNA markers) has become widespread for prediction of genetic merit in animal and plant breeding and it is gaining momentum as a prognostic tool for propensity to disease in human medicine. Although conceptually straightforward, genomic prediction is a very challenging problem. Genotyping organisms and recording phenotypic traits are time consuming and expensive. Resultant datasets often have many more features (markers) than samples (organisms). Therefore, models attempting to estimate the effects of markers often suffer from overﬁtting due to the curse of dimensionality. Feature selection is desirable in this setting to remove markers that do not appreciably affect the trait being predicted and amount to statistical noise. We present a differential evolution system for feature selection in genomic prediction problems and demonstrate its performance on simulated data.

However, evolutionary genomics studies have been slow to incorporate this technique to select individuals for breeding in a conservation context or to learn more about the genetic architecture of traits, the genetic value of missing individuals or microevolution of breeding values.

We explore this concept, using high-throughput phenotype information from Fourier transformed near-infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) of harvested kernels to predict parental grain yield in maize (Zea mays L.), and demonstrate a proof of concept for phenomic-based models in maize breeding. A dataset of 2,563 whole-kernel samples from a diversity panel of 346 hybrid testcrosses were scanned on a plot basis using NIRS. Scans consisted of 3,076 wavenumbers (bands) in the range of 4,000–10,000 cm−1. Corresponding grain yield for each sample was used to train phenomic prediction and selection models using three types of statistical learning: (a) partial least square regression (PLSR), (b) NIRS best linear unbiased predictor (NIRS BLUP), and (c) functional regression. Our results found that NIRS data were a useful tool to predict maize grain yield and showed promising results for evaluating genetically independent breeding populations. All model types were successful; functional regression followed by the PLSR model resulted in the best predictions. Pearson's correlations between predicted and observed grain yields exceeded .7 in many cases within random cross validation. Partial least squares regression also showed promise on independent breeding trials. More research on predicting phenotypic traits from spectra will provide better understanding how NIRS and other phenomic technology can be used in predicting phenotypes of breeding programs.",

		"abstract": "Natural hybrid zones offer a powerful framework for understanding the genetic basis of speciation in progress because ongoing hybridization continually creates unfavorable gene combinations. Evidence indicates that postzygotic reproductive isolation is often caused by epistatic interactions between mutations in different genes that evolved independently of one another (hybrid incompatibilities). We examined the potential to detect epistatic selection against incompatibilities from genome sequence data using the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of polymorphisms by conducting individual-based simulations in SLiM. We found that the genome-wide SFS in hybrid populations assumes a diagnostic shape, with the continual input of ﬁxed differences between source populations via migration inducing a mass at intermediate allele frequency. Epistatic selection locally distorts the SFS as non-incompatibility alleles rise in frequency in a manner analogous to a selective sweep. Building on these results, we present a statistical method to identify genomic regions containing incompatibility loci that locates departures in the local SFS compared with the genome-wide SFS. Crossvalidation studies demonstrate that our method detects recessive and codominant incompatibilities across a range of scenarios varying in the strength of epistatic selection, migration rate, and hybrid zone age. Our approach takes advantage of whole genome sequence data, does not require knowledge of demographic history, and can be applied to any pair of nascent species that forms a hybrid zone.",

		"abstract": "When two diverging species begin hybridizing, selection against hybridization is likely driven not by single substitutions, but by interactions between incompatible mutations. To identify these incompatibilities in natural populations, researchers examine the extent of nonrandom associations between ancestry at physically unlinked loci in admixed populations. In this approach, which we call ‘AD scans’, locus pairs with signiﬁcantly positive ‘ancestry disequilibrium’ (AD, i.e. locus pairs that positively covary by ancestry) represent incompatible alleles. Past research has uniformly revealed an excess of locus pairs with signiﬁcantly positive AD, suggesting that dozens to hundreds of incompatibilities separate species. With forward simulations, we show that many realistic demographic scenarios, including recent and/or ongoing hybridization, generate a bias towards positive ancestry disequilibrium. We suggest steps that researchers can take to avoid pitfalls in interpreting AD scans, and present a novel measure of AD, which minimizes but does not fully eliminate bias in the AD distribution. We also show, by simulation, that the tail of the AD distribution is enriched for true incompatibilities. To illustrate the potential power and appropriate caution in interpretation of AD scans, we reanalyse previously published data from two admixed populations of Xiphophorus ﬁshes. Our results imply that the prevalence of positive LD in admixed populations does not in itself support the idea that two-locus incompatibilities are widespread, but the co-enrichment of top AD hits across the two Xiphophorus populations supports the idea that AD scans can identify candidate interspeciﬁc incompatibilities.",

Most mapping and breeding approaches generally consider the additive part of variation but offer limited knowledge on the benefits of epistasis which explains in part the variation observed in traits. In this study, the cowpea multiparent advanced generation inter-cross (MAGIC) population was used to characterize the epistatic genetic architecture of flowering time, maturity, and seed size. In addition, consideration for epistatic genetic architecture in genomic-enabled breeding (GEB) was investigated using parametric, semi-parametric, and non-parametric genomic selection (GS) models. Our results showed that large and moderate effect–sized two-way epistatic interactions underlie the traits examined. Flowering time QTL colocalized with cowpea putative orthologs of Arabidopsis thaliana and Glycine max genes like PHYTOCLOCK1 (PCL1 [Vigun11g157600]) and PHYTOCHROME A (PHY A [Vigun01g205500]). Flowering time adaptation to long and short photoperiod was found to be controlled by distinct and common main and epistatic loci. Parametric and semi-parametric GS models outperformed non-parametric GS model, while using known quantitative trait nucleotide(s)  (QTNs) as fixed effects improved prediction accuracy when traits were controlled by large effect loci. In general, our study demonstrated that prior understanding of the genetic architecture of a trait can help make informed decisions in GEB.",

Recent reports have indicated that parametric methods are unable to predict phenotypes of traits with known epistatic genetic architectures. Herein, we review parametric methods including least squares regression, ridge regression, Bayesian ridge regression, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Bayesian LASSO, best linear unbiased prediction (BLUP), Bayes A, Bayes B, Bayes C, and Bayes C π. We also review nonparametric methods including Nadaraya-Watson estimator, reproducing kernel Hilbert space, support vector machine regression, and neural networks. We assess the relative merits of these 14 methods in terms of accuracy and mean squared error (MSE) using simulated genetic architectures consisting of completely additive or two-way epistatic interactions in an F2 population derived from crosses of inbred lines. Each simulated genetic architecture explained either 30% or 70% of the phenotypic variability. The greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE was due to genetic architecture. Parametric methods were unable to predict phenotypic values when the underlying genetic architecture was based entirely on epistasis. Parametric methods were slightly better than nonparametric methods for additive genetic architectures. Distinctions among parametric methods for additive genetic architectures were incremental. Heritability, i.e., proportion of phenotypic variability, had the second greatest impact on estimates of accuracy and MSE.",

		"abstract": "The increased accessibility to genomic data in recent years has laid the foundation for studies to predict various phenotypes of organisms based on the genome. Genomic prediction collectively refers to these studies, and it estimates an individual's phenotypes mainly using single nucleotide polymorphism markers. Typically, the accuracy of these genomic prediction studies is highly dependent on the markers used; however, in practice, choosing optimal markers with high accuracy for the phenotype to be used is a challenging task. Therefore, we present a new tool called GMStool for selecting optimal marker sets and predicting quantitative phenotypes. The GMStool is based on a genome-wide association study (GWAS) and heuristically searches for optimal markers using statistical and machine-learning methods. The GMStool performs the genomic prediction using statistical and machine/deep-learning models and presents the best prediction model with the optimal marker-set. For the evaluation, the GMStool was tested on real datasets with four phenotypes. The prediction results showed higher performance than using the entire markers or the GWAS-top markers, which have been used frequently in prediction studies. Although the GMStool has several limitations, it is expected to contribute to various studies for predicting quantitative phenotypes. The GMStool written in R is available at www.github.com/JaeYoonKim72/GMStool .",

		"abstract": "Analysis of a large number of markers is crucial in both genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and genome-wide selection (GWS). However there are two methodological issues that restrict statistical analysis: high dimensionality (p≫n) and multicollinearity. Although there are methodologies that can be used to fit models for data with high dimensionality (eg, the Bayesian Lasso), a big problem that can occurs in this cases is that the predictive ability of the model should perform well for the individuals used to fit the model, but should not perform well for other individuals, restricting the applicability of the model. This problem can be circumvent by applying some selection methodology to reduce the number of markers (but keeping the markers associated with the phenotypic trait) before adjusting a model to predict GBVs. We revisit a tournament-based strategy between marker samples, where each sample has good statistical properties for estimation: n>p and low collinearity. Such tournaments are elaborated using multiple linear regression to eliminate markers. This method is adapted from previous works found in the literature. We used simulated data as well as real data derived from a study with SNPs in beef cattle. Tournament strategies not only circumvent the p≫n issue, but also minimize spurious associations. For real data, when we selected a few more than 20 markers, we obtained correlations greater than 0.70 between predicted Genomic Breeding Values (GBVs) and phenotypes in validation groups of a cross-validation scheme; and when we selected a larger number of markers (more than 100), the correlations exceeded 0.90, showing the efficiency in identifying relevant SNPs (or segregations) for both GWAS and GWS. In the simulation study, we obtained similar results.",

		"abstract": "PREMISE OF THE STUDY: Evolutionary radiations provide excellent opportunities to study the origins of biodiversity, but rapid divergence and ongoing gene flow make inferring evolutionary relationships among taxa difficult. Consequently, combining morphological and genomic analyses will be necessary to clarify the evolutionary history of radiations. We used an integrative approach to shed light on relationships within a diverse radiation of monkeyflowers (Mimulus section Diplacus) with a controversial taxonomic history. METHODS: We used genomewide single nucleotide polymorphism data and a combination of phylogenetic and population genomic analyses to infer the evolutionary relationships within the group. Tests for hybridization were performed to reveal sources of shared variation, and multivariate analyses of floral trait data were conducted to examine the correspondence between phenotypic and phylogenetic data. KEY RESULTS: We identified four primary clades with evidence for some shared variation among them. We also detected evidence for recent gene flow between closely related subclades and populations. Strong discordance between floral trait and molecular data provides evidence for divergent and convergent phenotypic evolution. CONCLUSIONS: Mimulus section Diplacus has all the hallmarks of a rapid radiation, including diverse taxa that are at different stages of divergence, extensive shared variation among taxa, and complex patterns of phenotypic evolution. Our findings will direct future evolutionary research and have important taxonomic implications that highlight the need for a new revision of section Diplacus.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the evolutionary mechanisms that contribute to the local genetic differentiation of populations is a major goal of evolutionary biology, and debate continues regarding the relative importance of natural selection and random genetic drift to population differentiation. The desert plant Linanthus parryae has played a prominent role in these debates, with nearly six decades of empirical and theoretical work into the causes of spatial differentiation for ﬂower color. Plants produce either blue or white ﬂowers, and local populations often differ greatly in the frequencies of the two color morphs. Sewall Wright ﬁrst applied his model of “isolation by distance” to investigate spatial patterns of ﬂower color in Linanthus. He concluded that the distribution of ﬂower color morphs was due to random genetic drift, and that Linanthus provided an example of his shifting balance theory of evolution. Our results from comprehensive ﬁeld studies do not support this view. We studied an area in which ﬂower color changed abruptly from all-blue to all-white across a shallow ravine. Allozyme markers sampled across these regions showed no evidence of spatial differentiation, reciprocal transplant experiments revealed natural selection favoring the resident morph, and soils and the dominant members of the plant community differed between regions. These results support the hypothesis that local differences in ﬂower color are due to natural selection, not due to genetic drift.",

However, no single chromosome has been finished end to end, and hundreds of unresolved gaps persist\n              1,2\n              . Here we present a human genome assembly that surpasses the continuity of GRCh38\n              2\n              , along with a gapless, telomere-to-telomere assembly of a human chromosome. This was enabled by high-coverage, ultra-long-read nanopore sequencing of the complete hydatidiform mole CHM13 genome, combined with complementary technologies for quality improvement and validation. Focusing our efforts on the human X chromosome\n              3\n              , we reconstructed the centromeric satellite DNA array (approximately 3.1 Mb) and closed the 29 remaining gaps in the current reference, including new sequences from the human pseudoautosomal regions and from cancer-testis ampliconic gene families (CT-X and GAGE). These sequences will be integrated into future human reference genome releases. In addition, the complete chromosome X, combined with the ultra-long nanopore data, allowed us to map methylation patterns across complex tandem repeats and satellite arrays. Our results demonstrate that finishing the entire human genome is now within reach, and the data presented here will facilitate ongoing efforts to complete the other human chromosomes.",

Three of his insights have been reinforced by modern\n                        science. The first is that we share many characteristics (genetic,\n                        developmental, physiological, morphological, cognitive, and psychological)\n                        with our closest relatives, the anthropoid apes. The second is that humans\n                        have a talent for high-level cooperation reinforced by morality and social\n                        norms. The third is that we have greatly expanded the social learning\n                        capacity that we see already in other primates. Darwin’s emphasis on the\n                        role of culture deserves special attention because during an increasingly\n                        unstable Pleistocene environment, cultural accumulation allowed changes in\n                        life history; increased cognition; and the appearance of language, social\n                        norms, and institutions.",

		"abstract": "The literature on speciation has expanded dramatically in recent years, catalyzed by the emergence of new conceptual frameworks, new theoretical approaches, and new methods for characterizing pattern and inferring process. As a consequence, the language used to describe the speciation process has become more complex. Increasing complexity may be an accurate reflection of current thinking with respect to how phenotypic differences limit gene flow, how selection results in the evolution of reproductive isolation, and genetic changes that contribute to speciation. However, increased language complexity has come at a cost; old definitions have been reconfigured and new terms have been introduced. In some instances, the introduction of new terminology has failed to recognize historical usage, leading to unnecessary ambiguity and redundancy. Although the writings of Mayr and Dobzhansky remain a reference point in the language of speciation, the last decades of the 20th century saw substantial changes in our thinking about the speciation process. During that period, the language of speciation remained relatively stable. In contrast, the first decade of the 21st century has witnessed a remarkable expansion of the language of speciation. Here, the origin and evolution of ideas about speciation are viewed through the lens of changing language use.",

		"abstract": "The role of historical contingency in evolution has been much debated, but rarely tested. Twelve initially identical populations of Escherichia coli were founded in 1988 to investigate this issue. They have since evolved in a glucose-limited medium that also contains citrate, which E. coli cannot use as a carbon source under oxic conditions. No population evolved the capacity to exploit citrate for >30,000 generations, although each population tested billions of mutations. A citrate-using (Cit+) variant finally evolved in one population by 31,500 generations, causing an increase in population size and diversity. The long-delayed and unique evolution of this function might indicate the involvement of some extremely rare mutation. Alternately, it may involve an ordinary mutation, but one whose physical occurrence or phenotypic expression is contingent on prior mutations in that population. We tested these hypotheses in experiments that “replayed” evolution from different points in that population's history. We observed no Cit+ mutants among 8.4 × 1012 ancestral cells, nor among 9 × 1012 cells from 60 clones sampled in the first 15,000 generations. However, we observed a significantly greater tendency for later clones to evolve Cit+, indicating that some potentiating mutation arose by 20,000 generations. This potentiating change increased the mutation rate to Cit+ but did not cause generalized hypermutability. Thus, the evolution of this phenotype was contingent on the particular history of that population. More generally, we suggest that historical contingency is especially important when it facilitates the evolution of key innovations that are not easily evolved by gradual, cumulative selection.",

		"abstract": "Evolutionary novelties have been important in the history of life, but their origins are usually difficult to examine in detail. We previously described the evolution of a novel trait, aerobic citrate utilization (Cit+), in an experimental population of Escherichia coli. Here we analyse genome sequences to investigate the history and genetic basis of this trait. At least three distinct clades coexisted for more than 10,000 generations before its emergence. The Cit+ trait originated in one clade by a tandem duplication that captured an aerobically expressed promoter for the expression of a previously silent citrate transporter. The clades varied in their propensity to evolve this novel trait, although genotypes able to do so existed in all three clades, implying that multiple potentiating mutations arose during the population’s history. Our findings illustrate the importance of promoter capture and altered gene regulation in mediating the exaptation events that often underlie evolutionary innovations.",

		"abstract": "The evolution of self-fertilization in hermaphrodites is opposed by costs that decrease the value of self progeny relative to that of outcross progeny1,2,3. However, self-fertilization is common in plants4; 20% are highly selfing and 33% are intermediate between selfing and outcrossing5. Darwin6 proposed an adaptive benefit of self-pollination in providing reproductive assurance when outcrossing is impossible6,7,8,9. Moreover, if outcross pollen receipt is inconsistent within or between years, these conditions likewise favour self-pollination10, and this can result in a mixture of self and outcross seed production (mixed mating). Despite wide acceptance, the reproductive assurance hypothesis has lacked the support of complete empirical evidence to show that variable pollination can create both the ecological and genetic conditions favouring self-pollination. We recently showed in Collinsia verna that during periods of infrequent pollinator visits, autonomous self-pollination boosted seed output per flower11, the key ecological condition. Here we show low inbreeding depression and marker-based estimates of selfing, demonstrating that when the pollination environment in wild populations necessitates reproductive assurance, selfing rates increase. We provide a complete demonstration of reproductive assurance under variable pollination environments and mechanistically link reproductive assurance to intermediate selfing rates through mixed mating.",

		"abstract": "The transition from outcrossing to self-fertilization is one of the most common evolutionary changes in plants, yet only about 10-15% of flowering plants are predominantly selfing. To explain this phenomenon, Stebbins proposed that selfing may be an 'evolutionary dead end'. According to this hypothesis, transitions from outcrossing to selfing are irreversible, and selfing lineages suffer from an increased risk of extinction owing to a reduced potential for adaptation. Thus, although selfing can be advantageous in the short term, selfing lineages may be mostly short-lived owing to higher extinction rates. Here, we review recent results relevant to the 'dead-end hypothesis' of selfing and the maintenance of outcrossing over longer evolutionary time periods. In particular, we highlight recent results regarding diversification rates in self-incompatible and self-compatible taxa, and review evidence regarding the accumulation of deleterious mutations in selfing lineages. We conclude that while some aspects of the hypothesis of selfing as a dead end are supported by theory and empirical results, the evolutionary and ecological mechanisms remain unclear. We highlight the need for more studies on the effects of quantitative changes in outcrossing rates and on the potential for adaptation, particularly in selfing plants. In addition, there is growing evidence that transitions to selfing may themselves be drivers of speciation, and future studies of diversification and speciation should investigate this further.",

The table is equipped with an automated supply for water and nutrients. The entire setup is placed in a climate-chamber with carefully controlled lighting and atmospheric conditions. We will present a fully automated measurement system that monitors the development of each individual seedling by high resolution time-lapse photography. ImageJ is used to analyze the photographs.

Further, it takes too much time and eﬀort to have suﬃcient number of samplings especially length and width. These diﬃculties prevented seed morphology to be incorporated into eﬃcient breeding program. Here, we propose methods for an image acquisition, a data processing, and analysis for the morphology and color of soybean seeds by high-throughput method using images analysis. As results, quantitative values for colors and various types of morphological traits could be screened to create a standard for subsequent evaluation of the genotype. Phenotyping method in the current study could deﬁne the morphology and color of soybean seeds in highly accurate and reliable manner. Further, this method enables the measurement and analysis of large amounts of plant seed phenotype data in a short time, which was not possible before. Fast and precise phenotype data obtained here may facilitate Genome Wide Association Study for the gene function analysis as well as for development of the elite varieties having desirable seed traits.",

		"abstract": "Biodiversity promotes ecosystem function as a consequence of functional differences among organisms that enable resource partitioning and facilitation. As the need for biodiversity assessments increases in the face of accelerated global change, novel approaches that are rapid, repeatable and scalable are critical, especially in ecosystems for which information about species identity and the number of species is difficult to acquire. Here, we present 'spectral diversity'—a spectroscopic index of the variability of electromagnetic radiation reflected from plants measured in the visible, near-infrared and short-wave infrared regions (400–2,400 nm). Using data collected from the Cedar Creek biodiversity experiment (Minnesota, USA), we provide evidence that the dissimilarity of species' leaf spectra increases with functional dissimilarity and evolutionary divergence time. Spectral diversity at the leaf level explains 51% of total variation in productivity—a proportion comparable to taxonomic (47%), functional (51%) or phylogenetic diversity (48%)—and performs similarly when calculated from high-resolution canopy image spectra. Spectral diversity is an emerging dimension of plant biodiversity that integrates trait variation within and across species even in the absence of taxonomic, functional, phylogenetic or abundance information, and has the potential to transform biodiversity assessment because of its scalability to remote sensing.",

However, we do not yet understand how spectra vary across the tree of life or how the evolution of leaf traits affects the differentiation of spectra among species and lineages. Here we describe a framework that integrates spectra with phylogenies and apply it to a global dataset of over 16 000 leaf-level spectra (400–2400 nm) for 544 seed plant species. We test for phylogenetic signal in spectra, evaluate their ability to classify lineages, and characterize their evolutionary dynamics. We show that phylogenetic signal is present in leaf spectra but that the spectral regions most strongly associated with the phylogeny vary among lineages. Despite among-lineage heterogeneity, broad plant groups, orders, and families can be identified from reflectance spectra. Evolutionary models also reveal that different spectral regions evolve at different rates and under different constraint levels, mirroring the evolution of their underlying traits. Leaf spectra capture the phylogenetic history of seed plants and the evolutionary dynamics of leaf chemistry and structure. Consequently, spectra have the potential to provide breakthrough assessments of leaf evolution and plant phylogenetic diversity at global scales.",

We demonstrate how strategic integration of exotic material alleviates the D genome genetic bottleneck in wheat, increasing SNP rate by 62% largely due to Ae. tauschii synthetic wheat donors. Across the panel, 67% of the Ae. tauschii donor genome is represented as introgressions in elite backgrounds.

Therefore, breeding of varieties adapted to the constantly changing conditions is pivotal to enable a quantitatively and qualitatively adequate crop production despite the negative effects of climate change. As it is not yet possible to select for adaptation to future climate scenarios in the field, simulations of future conditions in controlled-environment (CE) phenotyping facilities contribute to the understanding of the plant response to special stress conditions and help breeders to select ideal genotypes which cope with future conditions. CE phenotyping facilities enable the collection of traits that are not easy to measure under field conditions and the assessment of a plant‘s phenotype under repeatable, clearly defined environmental conditions using automated, non-invasive, high-throughput methods. However, extrapolation and translation of results obtained under controlled environments to field environments is ambiguous. This review outlines the opportunities and challenges of phenotyping approaches under controlled environments complementary to conventional field trials. It gives an overview on general principles and introduces existing phenotyping facilities that take up the challenge of obtaining reliable and robust phenotypic data on climate response traits to support breeding of climate-adapted crops.",

		"abstract": "Plants with improved nutrient use efficiency are needed to maintain and enhance future crop plant production. The aim of this study was to explore candidate traits for pre-breeding to improve nutrient accumulation and early vigor of spring wheat grown at high latitudes. We quantified shoot and root traits together with nutrient accumulation in nine contrasting spring wheat genotypes grown in rhizoboxes for 20 days in a greenhouse. Whole-plant relative growth rate was here correlated with leaf area productivity and plant nitrogen productivity, but not leaf area ratio. Furthermore, the total leaf area was correlated with the accumulation of six macronutrients, and could be suggested as a candidate trait for the pre-breeding towards improved nutrient accumulation and early vigor in wheat to be grown in high-latitude environments. Depending on the nutrient of interest, different root system traits were identified as relevant for their accumulation. Accumulation of nitrogen, potassium, sulfur and calcium was correlated with lateral root length, whilst accumulation of phosphorus and magnesium was correlated with main root length. Therefore, special attention needs to be paid to specific root system traits in the breeding of wheat towards improved nutrient accumulation to counteract the suboptimal uptake of some nutrient elements.",

Noninvasive technologies are used to analyze experimental and breeding populations. We cover the most recent research in controlled-environment and field phenotyping for seed, shoot, and root traits. Select field phenotyping technologies have become state of the art and show promise for speeding up the breeding process in early generations. We highlight the technologies behind the rapid advances in proximal and remote sensing of plants in fields. We conclude by discussing the new disciplines working with the phenotyping community: data science, to address the challenge of generating FAIR (findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable) data, and robotics, to apply phenotyping directly on farms.",

		"abstract": "Photosynthesis is a pivotal process in plant physiology, and its regulation plays an important role in plant defense against biotic stress. Interactions with pathogens and pests often cause alterations in the metabolism of sugars and sink/source relationships. These changes can be part of the plant defense mechanisms to limit nutrient availability to the pathogens. In other cases, these alterations can be the result of pests manipulating the plant metabolism for their own benefit. The effects of biotic stress on plant physiology are typically heterogeneous, both spatially and temporarily. Chlorophyll fluorescence imaging is a powerful tool to mine the activity of photosynthesis at cellular, leaf, and whole-plant scale, allowing the phenotyping of plants. This review will recapitulate the responses of the photosynthetic machinery to biotic stress factors, from pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and fungi) to pests (herbivory) analyzed by chlorophyll fluorescence imaging both at the lab and field scale. Moreover, chlorophyll fluorescence imagers and alternative techniques to indirectly evaluate photosynthetic traits used at field scale are also revised.",

		"abstract": "Abstract.— Hybrid sterility and inviability often result from the accumulation of substitutions that, while functional on their normal genetic backgrounds, cause a loss of fitness when brought together in hybrids. Previous theory has shown that such Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities should accumulate at least as fast as the square of the number of substitutions separating two species, the so-called snowball effect. Here we explicitly describe the stochastic accumulation of these incompatibilities as a function of time. The accumulation of these incompatibilities involves three levels of stochasticity: (1) the number of substitutions separating two allopatric lineages at a given time; (2) the number of incompatibilities resulting from these substitutions; and (3) the fitness effects of individual incompatibilities. Previous analyses ignored the stochasticity of molecular evolution (level 1) as well as that due to the variable effects of incompatibilities (level 3). Here we approximate the full stochastic process characterizing the accumulation of hybrid incompatibilities between pairs of loci. We derive the distribution of the number of incompatibilities as a function of divergence time between allopatric taxa as well as the distribution of waiting times to speciation by postzygotic isolation. We provide simple approximations for the mean and variance of these waiting times. These results let us estimate, albeit crudely, the probability, p, that two diverged sites from different species will contribute to hybrid sterility or inviability. Our analyses of data from Drosophila and Bombina suggest that p is generally very small, on the order of 10−6 or less.",

However, heterosis in hybrids can emerge if hybridization breaks down detrimental epistatic interaction within parental lineages. In this study, we examined the life history fitness of the interspecific F1s of two recently diverged microcrustacean species, Daphnia pulex and D. pulicaria, as well as intraspecific crosses of D. pulex. We identified heterosis in two of five life history traits in the interspecific F1s. According to theories that heterosis can transiently emerge in early speciation, the observation of heterosis in these life history traits suggests that there are no major genetic incompatibilities between these two species affecting these traits and that D. pulex and D. pulicaria are at an early stage of speciation.",

		"abstract": "A primary roadblock to our understanding of speciation is that it usually occurs over a timeframe that is too long to study from start to finish. The idea of a speciation continuum provides something of a solution to this problem; rather than observing the entire process, we can simply reconstruct it from the multitude of speciation events that surround us. But what do we really mean when we talk about the speciation continuum, and can it really help us understand speciation? We explored these questions using a literature review and online survey of speciation researchers. Although most researchers were familiar with the concept and thought it was useful, our survey revealed extensive disagreement about what the speciation continuum actually tells us. This is due partly to the lack of a clear definition. Here, we provide an explicit definition that is compatible with the Biological Species Concept. That is, the speciation continuum is a continuum of reproductive isolation. After outlining the logic of the definition in light of alternatives, we explain why attempts to reconstruct the speciation process from present-day populations will ultimately fail. We then outline how we think the speciation continuum concept can continue to act as a foundation for understanding the continuum of reproductive isolation that surrounds us.",

		"abstract": "Proteins are the workhorses of the cell and execute many of their functions by interacting with other proteins forming protein complexes. Multi-protein complexes are an admixture of subunits, change their interaction partners, and modulate their functions and cellular physiology in response to environmental changes. When two species mate, the hybrid offspring are usually inviable or sterile because of large-scale differences in the genetic makeup between the two parents causing incompatible genetic interactions. Such reciprocal-sign epistasis between inter-specific alleles is not limited to incompatible interactions between just one gene pair; and, usually involves multiple genes. Many of these multi-locus incompatibilities show visible defects, only in the presence of all the interactions, making it hard to characterize. Understanding the dynamics of protein-protein interactions (PPIs) leading to multi-protein complexes is better suited to characterize multi-locus incompatibilities, compared to studying them with traditional approaches of genetics and molecular biology. The advances in omics technologies, which includes genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics can help achieve this end. This is especially relevant when studying non-model organisms. Here, we discuss the recent progress in the understanding of hybrid genetic incompatibility; omics technologies, and how together they have helped in characterizing protein complexes and in turn multi-locus incompatibilities. We also review advances in bioinformatic techniques suitable for this purpose and propose directions for leveraging the knowledge gained from model-organisms to identify genetic incompatibilities in non-model organisms.",

However, typically these effects are shown by taking parents of known genotype into the laboratory and measuring components of the F1 progeny under laboratory conditions. This leaves in doubt the real significance of such effects in the field. Here we use the well-known colour pattern genotypes of the African monarch or queen (Danaus chrysippus), which also control wing length, to test these effects both in the laboratory and in a contact zone in the field. By measuring the wing lengths in animals of known colour pattern genotype we show clear evidence for all three hybrid effects at the A and BC colour patterning loci, and importantly, that these same effects persist in the same presumptive F1s when measured in hybrid populations in the field. This demonstrates the power of a system in which genotypes can be directly inferred in the field and highlights that all three hybrid effects can be seen in the East African contact zone of this fascinating butterfly.",

		"abstract": "Natural hybrid zones offer a powerful framework for understanding the genetic basis of speciation in progress because ongoing hybridization continually creates unfavorable gene combinations. Evidence indicates that postzygotic reproductive isolation is often caused by epistatic interactions between mutations in different genes that evolved independently of one another (hybrid incompatibilities). We examined the potential to detect epistatic selection against incompatibilities from genome sequence data using the site frequency spectrum (SFS) of polymorphisms by conducting individual-based simulations in SLiM. We found that the genome-wide SFS in hybrid populations assumes a diagnostic shape, with the continual input of fixed differences between source populations via migration inducing a mass at intermediate allele frequency. Epistatic selection locally distorts the SFS as non-incompatibility alleles rise in frequency in a manner analogous to a selective sweep. Building on these results, we present a statistical method to identify genomic regions containing incompatibility loci that locates departures in the local SFS compared with the genome-wide SFS. Cross-validation studies demonstrate that our method detects recessive and codominant incompatibilities across a range of scenarios varying in the strength of epistatic selection, migration rate, and hybrid zone age. Our approach takes advantage of whole genome sequence data, does not require knowledge of demographic history, and can be applied to any pair of nascent species that forms a hybrid zone.",

		"abstract": "How species evolve reproductive isolation in the species-rich Amazon basin is poorly understood in vertebrates. Here, we sequenced a reference genome and used a genome-wide sample of SNPs to analyze a hybrid zone between two highly cryptic species of Hypocnemis warbling-antbirds—the Rondonia warbling-antbird (H. ochrogyna) and Spix's warbling-antbird (H. striata)—in a headwater region of southern Amazonia. We found that both species commonly hybridize, producing F1s and a variety of backcrosses with each species but we detected only one F2-like hybrid. Patterns of heterozygosity, hybrid index, and interchromosomal linkage disequilibrium in hybrid populations closely match expectations under strong postzygotic isolation. Hybrid zone width (15.4 km) was much narrower than expected (211 km) indicating strong selection against hybrids. A remarkably high degree of concordance in cline centers and widths across loci, and a lack of reduced interspecific Fst between populations close to versus far from the contact zone, suggest that genetic incompatibilities have rendered most of the genome immune to introgression. These results support intrinsic postzygotic isolation as a driver of speciation in a moderately young cryptic species pair from the Amazon and suggest that species richness of the Amazon may be grossly underestimated.",

		"abstract": "All genes interact with other genes, and their additive effects and epistatic interactions affect an organism's phenotype and fitness. Recent theoretical and empirical work has advanced our understanding of the role of multi-locus interactions in speciation. However, relating different models to one another and to empirical observations is challenging. This review focuses on multi-locus interactions that lead to reproductive isolation (RI) through reduced hybrid fitness. We first review theoretical approaches and show how recent work incorporating a mechanistic understanding of multi-locus interactions recapitulates earlier models, but also makes novel predictions concerning the build-up of RI. These include high variance in the build-up rate of RI among taxa, the emergence of strong incompatibilities producing localized barriers to introgression, and an effect of population size on the build-up of RI. We then review recent experimental approaches to detect multi-locus interactions underlying RI using genomic data. We argue that future studies would benefit from overlapping methods like ancestry disequilibrium scans, genome scans of differentiation and analyses of hybrid gene expression. Finally, we highlight a need for further overlap between theoretical and empirical work, and approaches that predict what kind of patterns multi-locus interactions resulting in incompatibilities will leave in genome-wide polymorphism data.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Molecular ecologists often rely on phylogenetic evidence for assessing the species-level systematics of newly discovered lineages. Alternatively, the extent of introgression at phylogeographic transitions can provide a more direct test to assign candidate taxa into subspecies or species categories. Here, we compared phylogenetic versus hybrid zone approaches of species delimitation in two groups of frogs from the Western Mediterranean region (Discoglossus and Pelodytes), by using genomic data (ddRAD). In both genera, coalescent analyses recovered almost all nominal taxa as “species”. However, the least-diverged pairs D. g. galganoi/jeanneae and P. punctatus/hespericus admix over hundreds of kilometers, suggesting that they have not yet developed strong reproductive isolation and should be treated as conspecifics. In contrast, the comparatively older D. scovazzi/pictus and P. atlanticus/ibericus form narrow contact zones, consistent with species distinctiveness. Due to their complementarity, we recommend taxonomists to combine phylogenomics with hybrid zone analyses to scale the gray zone of speciation, i.e., the evolutionary window separating widely admixing lineages versus nascent reproductively isolated species. The radically different transitions documented here conform to the view that genetic incompatibilities accumulating with divergence generate a weak barrier to gene flow for long periods of time, until their effects multiply and the speciation process then advances rapidly. Given the variability of the gray zone among taxonomic groups, at least from our current abilities to measure it, we recommend to customize divergence thresholds within radiations to categorize lineages for which no direct test of speciation is possible.",

		"abstract": "The Anopheles gambiae complex is comprised of eight morphologically indistinguishable species and has emerged as a model system for the study of speciation genetics due to the rapid radiation of its member species over the past two million years. Male hybrids between most An. gambiae complex species pairs are sterile, and some genotype combinations in hybrid males cause inviability. We investigated the genetic basis of hybrid male inviability and sterility between An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus by measuring segregation distortion and performing a QTL analysis of sterility in a backcross population. Hybrid males were inviable if they inherited the An. coluzzii X chromosome and were homozygous at one or more loci in 18.9 Mb region of chromosome 3. The An. coluzzii X chromosome has a disproportionately large effect on hybrid sterility when introgressed into an An. quadriannulatus genetic background. Additionally, an epistatic interaction between the An. coluzzii X and a 1.12 Mb, pericentric region of the An. quadriannulatus 3L chromosome arm has a statistically significant contribution to the hybrid sterility phenotype. This same epistatic interaction occurs when the An. coluzzii X is introgressed into the genetic background of An. arabiensis, the sister species of An. quadriannulatus, suggesting that this may represent one of the first Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities to evolve early in the radiation of the Anopheles gambiae species complex. We describe the additive effects of each sterility QTL, epistatic interactions between them, and genes within QTL with protein functions related to mating behavior, reproduction, spermatogenesis, and microtubule morphogenesis, whose divergence may contribute to post-zygotic reproductive isolation between An. coluzzii and An. quadriannulatus.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: The process by which populations evolve to become new species involves the emergence of various reproductive isolating barriers (RIB). Despite major advancements in understanding this complex process, very little is known about the order in which RIBs evolve or their relative contribution to the total restriction of gene flow during various stages of speciation. This is mainly due to the difficulties of studying reproductive isolation during the early stages of species formation. This study examines ecological and non-ecological RIB within and between Daphnia pulex and Daphnia pulicaria, two recently diverged species that inhabit distinct habitats and exhibit an unusual level of intraspecific genetic subdivision.\nRESULTS: We find that while ecological prezygotic barriers are close to completion, none of the non-ecological barriers can restrict gene flow between D. pulex and D. pulicaria completely when acting alone. Surprisingly, we also identified high levels of postzygotic reproductive isolation in 'conspecific' interpopulation crosses of D. pulex.\nCONCLUSIONS: While the ecological prezygotic barriers are prevalent during the mature stages of speciation, non-ecological barriers likely dominated the early stages of speciation. This finding indicates the importance of studying the very early stages of speciation and suggests the contribution of postzygotic isolation in initiating the process of speciation.",

		"abstract": "The evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation is an important component of speciation. But before isolation is complete there is sometimes a phase of heterosis in which hybrid fitness exceeds that of the two parental species. The genetics and evolution of heterosis and postzygotic isolation have typically been studied in isolation, precluding the development of a unified theory of speciation. Here, we develop a model that incorporates both positive and negative gene interactions, and accounts for the evolution of both heterosis and postzygotic isolation. We parameterize the model with recent data on the fitness effects of 10,000 mutations in yeast, singly and in pairwise epistatic combinations. The model makes novel predictions about the types of interactions that contribute to declining hybrid fitness. We reproduce patterns familiar from earlier models of speciation (e.g. Haldane’s Rule and Darwin’s Corollary) and identify new mechanisms that may underlie these patterns. Our approach provides a general framework for integrating experimental data from gene interaction networks into speciation theory and makes new predictions about the genetic mechanisms of speciation.",

		"abstract": "Assessing directional bias in interspecific gene flow might be important in determining the evolutionary trajectory of closely related species pairs. Using a set of 300 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) having variable propensity to cross species boundary, we evaluated the genomic extent and direction of interspecific gene flow in a progenitor-derivative spruce species pair (black spruce and red spruce). A higher rate of gene flow was found from black spruce toward red spruce purebreds than vice versa. This asymmetry could reflect the historical gene flow between the two taxa at the time of species inception and during postglacial colonization. A clear asymmetry in introgression was depicted by a greater gene flow between red spruce and hybrids than between black spruce and hybrids. While backcrossing toward red spruce was invariably high across the genome, the actual species boundary is between hybrids and black spruce where gene flow is impeded at those genomic regions impermeable to introgression. Associations between hybrid index and climatic variables (total annual precipitation and mean annual temperature) were tested, as these might indicate a role for exogenous selection in maintaining the species boundary. While an apparent association was found between the hybrid index and precipitation, it collapsed when considered in light of the directional bias in interspecific gene flow. Hence, considering asymmetrical patterns of introgression allowed us to falsify an apparent role for exogenous selection. Although this was not formerly tested here, we suggest that this pattern could result from asymmetrical endogenous selection, a contention that deserves further investigations.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive isolation can evolve readily when genotypes containing incompatible alleles are connected by chains of fit intermediates. Experimental crosses show that such Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are often complex (involving alleles at three or more loci) and asymmetrical (such that reciprocal introgressions have very different effects on fitness). One possible explanation is that asymmetrical and complex DMIs are ‘easier to evolve’, because they block fewer of the possible evolutionary paths between the parental genotypes. To assess this argument, we model evolutionary divergence in allopatry and calculate the delays to divergence caused by DMIs of different kinds. We find that the number of paths is sometimes, though not always, a reliable predictor of the time to divergence. In particular, we find limited support for the idea that symmetrical DMIs take longer to evolve, but this applies largely to two-locus symmetrical DMIs (which leave no path of fit intermediates). Symmetrical complex DMIs can also delay divergence, but only in a limited region of parameter space. In most other cases, the presence and form of DMIs have little influence on times to divergence, and so we argue that ease of evolution is unlikely to be important in explaining the experimental data.",

In addition to creating hybrids in the laboratory, biologists can take advantage of natural hybrid zones to understand the factors that shape gene flow between divergent lineages. In the early stages of speciation, most regions of the genome continue to flow freely between populations. Alternatively, the subset of the genome that confers reproductive barriers between nascent species is expected to reject introgression. Now enabled by advances in genomics, this perspective is motivating detailed comparisons of gene flow across genomic regions in hybrid zones. Here, I review methods for measuring and interpreting introgression at multiple loci in hybrid zones, focusing on the problem of identifying loci that contribute to reproductive isolation. Emerging patterns from multi-locus studies of hybrid zones are highlighted, including remarkable variance in introgression across the genome. Although existing methods have been useful, there is scope for development of new analytical approaches that better connect differential patterns of gene flow in hybrid zones with current knowledge of speciation mechanisms.

Although theoretical studies have addressed their evolution, little is known about their maintenance when challenged by potentially high migration rates in secondary contact. Although theory predicts that recombination can erode barriers, many empirical systems have been found to retain species-specific differences despite substantial gene flow. By simulating whole genomes in individuals of hybridizing species, we find that the genetic architecture of two contrasting models of epistatic hybrid incompatibilities and the context of hybridization can substantially affect species integrity and genomic heterogeneity. In line with theory, our results show that intergenomic incompatibilities break down rapidly by recombination, but can maintain genome-wide differentiation under very limited conditions. By contrast, intragenomic interactions that arise from genetic pathways can maintain species-specific differences even with high migration rates and gene flow, whereas introgression at large parts of the genome can simultaneously remain extensive, consistent with empirical observations. We discuss the importance of intragenomic interactions in speciation and consider how this form of epistatic fitness variation is implicated and supported by other theoretical and empirical studies. We further address the relevance of replicates and knowledge of context when investigating the genomics of speciation.",

However, genetic study is often restricted to model organisms that have short generation times and are easily propagated in the laboratory. Replicate hybrid zones with a diversity of recombinant genotypes of varying age offer increased resolution for genetic mapping experiments and expand the pool of organisms amenable to genetic study. Using 88 markers distributed across 17 chromosomes, we analyze the introgression of chromosomal segments of Helianthus petiolaris into H. annuus in three natural hybrid zones. Introgression was significantly reduced relative to neutral expectations for 26 chromosomal segments, suggesting that each segment contains one or more factors that contribute to isolation. Pollen sterility is significantly associated with 16 of these 26 segments, providing a straightforward explanation of why this subset of blocks is disadvantageous in hybrids. In addition, comparison of rates of introgression across colinear vs. rearranged chromosomes indicates that close to 50% of the barrier to introgression is due to chromosomal rearrangements. These results demonstrate the utility of hybrid zones for identifying factors contributing to isolation and verify the prediction of increased resolution relative to controlled crosses.",

It is adaptive when such introgressed alleles are maintained by natural selection. Recently, there has been an explosion in the number of studies on adaptive introgression. In this review, we take a plant perspective centred on four lines of evidence: (i) introgression, (ii) selection, (iii) phenotype and (iv) fitness. While advances in genomics have contributed to our understanding of introgression and porous species boundaries (task 1), and the detection of signatures of selection in introgression (task 2), the investigation of adaptive introgression critically requires links to phenotypic variation and fitness (tasks 3 and 4). We also discuss the conservation implications of adaptive introgression in the face of climate change. Adaptive introgression is particularly important in rapidly changing environments, when standing genetic variation and mutation alone may only offer limited potential for adaptation. We conclude that clarifying the magnitude and fitness effects of introgression with improved statistical techniques, coupled with phenotypic evidence, has great potential for conservation and management efforts.",

Herein, we clarify what hybrid zones are, what is (and is not) known about them, and how different types of genomic data contribute to our understanding of hybrid zones. We then review two key topics, namely, what genomic analyses of hybrid zones have revealed about the basis and dynamics of speciation and how hybrid zones directly affect evolutionary processes. In the latter case, we emphasize the importance of contingency and ecological and genomic context in outcomes of hybridization. Throughout, we highlight limitations and key unknowns, and suggest approaches most likely to advance our understanding of hybrid zones and evolutionary processes in general.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization is a potent evolutionary process that can affect the origin, maintenance, and loss of biodiversity. Because of its ecological and evolutionary consequences, an understanding of hybridization is important for basic and applied sciences, including conservation biology and agriculture. Herein, we review and discuss ideas that are relevant to the recognition of hybrids and hybridization. We supplement this discussion with simulations. The ideas we present have a long history, particularly in botany, and clarifying them should have practical consequences for managing hybridization and gene flow in plants. One of our primary goals is to illustrate what we can and cannot infer about hybrids and hybridization from molecular data; in other words, we ask when genetic analyses commonly used to study hybridization might mislead us about the history or nature of gene flow and selection. We focus on patterns of variation when hybridization is recent and populations are polymorphic, which are particularly informative for applied issues, such as contemporary hybridization following recent ecological change. We show that hybridization is not a singular process, but instead a collection of related processes with variable outcomes and consequences. Thus, it will often be inappropriate to generalize about the threats or benefits of hybridization from individual studies, and at minimum, it will be important to avoid categorical thinking about what hybridization and hybrids are. We recommend potential sampling and analytical approaches that should help us confront these complexities of hybridization.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the process by which hybrid incompatibility alleles become established in natural populations remains a major challenge to evolutionary biology. Previously, we discovered a two-locus Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility that causes severe hybrid male sterility between two inbred lines of the incompletely isolated wildflower species, Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. An interspecific cross between these two inbred lines revealed that the M. guttatus (IM62) allele at hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) acts dominantly in combination with recessive M. nasutus (SF5) alleles at hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) to cause nearly complete hybrid male sterility. In this report, we extend these genetic analyses to investigate intraspecific variation for the hms1–hms2 incompatibility in natural populations of M. nasutus and M. guttatus, performing a series of interspecific crosses between individuals collected from a variety of geographic locales. Our results suggest that hms2 incompatibility alleles are common and geographically widespread within M. nasutus, but absent or rare in M. guttatus. In contrast, the hms1 locus is polymorphic within M. guttatus and the incompatibility allele appears to be extremely geographically restricted. We found evidence for the presence of the hms1 incompatibility allele in only two M. guttatus populations that exist within a few kilometers of each other. The restricted distribution of the hms1 incompatibility allele might currently limit the potential for the hms1–hms2 incompatibility to act as a species barrier between sympatric populations of M. guttatus and M. nasutus. Extensive sampling within a single M. guttatus population revealed that the hms1 locus is polymorphic and that the incompatibility allele appears to segregate at intermediate frequency, a pattern that is consistent with either genetic drift or natural selection.",

		"abstract": "Incompletely isolated species provide an opportunity to investigate the genetic mechanisms and evolutionary forces that maintain distinct species in the face of ongoing gene flow. Here, we use field surveys and reduced representation sequencing to characterize the patterns of reproductive isolation, admixture and genomic divergence between populations of the outcrossing wildflower Mimulus guttatus and selfing M. nasutus. Focusing on a single site where these two species have come into secondary contact, we find that phenological isolation is strong, although incomplete, and is likely driven by divergence in response to photoperiod. In contrast to previous field studies, which have suggested that F1-hybrid formation might be rare, we discover patterns of genomic variation consistent with ongoing introgression. Strikingly, admixed individuals vary continuously from highly admixed to nearly pure M. guttatus, demonstrating ongoing hybridization and asymmetric introgression from M. nasutus into M. guttatus. Patterns of admixture and divergence across the genome show that levels of introgression are more variable than expected by chance. Some genomic regions show a reduced introgression, including one region that overlaps a critical photoperiod QTL, whereas other regions show elevated levels of interspecific gene flow. In addition, we observe a genome-wide negative relationship between absolute divergence and the local recombination rate, potentially indicating natural selection against M. nasutus ancestry in M. guttatus genetic backgrounds. Together, our results suggest that Mimulus speciation is both ongoing and dynamic and that a combination of divergence in phenology and mating system, as well as selection against interspecific alleles, likely maintains these sympatric species.",

		"abstract": "Hybrids between flowering plant species often exhibit reduced fitness, including sterility and inviability. Such hybrid incompatibilities create barriers to genetic exchange that can promote reproductive isolation between diverging populations and, ultimately, speciation. Additionally, hybrid breakdown opens a window into hidden molecular and evolutionary processes occurring within species. Here, we review recent work on the mechanisms and origins of hybrid incompatibility in flowering plants, including both diverse genic interactions and chromosomal incompatibilities. Conflict and coevolution among and within plant genomes contributes to the evolution of some well-characterized genic incompatibilities, but duplication and drift also play important roles. Inversions, while contributing to speciation by suppressing recombination, rarely cause underdominant sterility. Translocations cause severe F1 sterility by disrupting meiosis in heterozygotes, making their fixation in outcrossing sister species a paradox. Evolutionary genomic analyses of both genic and chromosomal incompatibilities, in the context of population genetic theory, can explicitly test alternative scenarios for their origins.",

		"abstract": "This study aims to test the performances of a low-cost and automatic phenotyping platform, consisting of a Red-Green-Blue (RGB) commercial camera scanning objects on rotating plates and the reconstruction of main plant phenotypic traits via the structure for motion approach (SfM). The precision of this platform was tested in relation to three-dimensional (3D) models generated from images of potted maize, tomato and olive tree, acquired at a different frequency (steps of 4&deg;, 8&deg; and 12&deg;) and quality (4.88, 6.52 and 9.77 &micro;m/pixel). Plant and organs heights, angles and areas were extracted from the 3D models generated for each combination of these factors. Coefficient of determination (R2), relative Root Mean Square Error (rRMSE) and Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) were used as goodness-of-fit indexes to compare the simulated to the observed data. The results indicated that while the best performances in reproducing plant traits were obtained using 90 images at 4.88 &micro;m/pixel (R2 = 0.81, rRMSE = 9.49% and AIC = 35.78), this corresponded to an unviable processing time (from 2.46 h to 28.25 h for herbaceous plants and olive trees, respectively). Conversely, 30 images at 4.88 &micro;m/pixel resulted in a good compromise between a reliable reconstruction of considered traits (R2 = 0.72, rRMSE = 11.92% and AIC = 42.59) and processing time (from 0.50 h to 2.05 h for herbaceous plants and olive trees, respectively). In any case, the results pointed out that this input combination may vary based on the trait under analysis, which can be more or less demanding in terms of input images and time according to the complexity of its shape (R2 = 0.83, rRSME = 10.15% and AIC = 38.78). These findings highlight the reliability of the developed low-cost platform for plant phenotyping, further indicating the best combination of factors to speed up the acquisition and elaboration process, at the same time minimizing the bias between observed and simulated data.",

Although the field has made impressive progress in documenting the extent of natural hybridization, both historical and recent, there are still many unanswered questions about its genetic and evolutionary consequences. Recent work has suggested that the outcomes of hybridization in the genome may be in part predictable, but many open questions about the nature of selection on hybrids and the biological variables that shape such selection have hampered progress in this area. We synthesize what is known about the mechanisms that drive changes in ancestry in the genome after hybridization, highlight major unresolved questions, and discuss their implications for the predictability of genome evolution after hybridization.",

Hybrid necrosis is an example of a deleterious phenotype caused by epistatic interactions that is observed in many intra- and interspecific plant hybrids. A large number of hybrid necrosis cases share phenotypic similarities, suggesting a common underlying mechanism across a wide range of plant species. Here, we report that approximately 2% of intraspecific crosses in Arabidopsis thaliana yield F1 progeny that express necrosis when grown under conditions typical of their natural habitats. We show that several independent cases result from epistatic interactions that trigger autoimmune-like responses. In at least one case, an allele of an NB-LRR disease resistance gene homolog is both necessary and sufficient for the induction of hybrid necrosis, when combined with a specific allele at a second locus. The A. thaliana cases provide insights into the molecular causes of hybrid necrosis, and serve as a model for further investigation of intra- and interspecific incompatibilities caused by a simple epistatic interaction. Moreover, our finding that plant immune-system genes are involved in hybrid necrosis suggests that selective pressures related to host–pathogen conflict might cause the evolution of gene flow barriers in plants.",

		"abstract": "Post-zygotic genetic incompatibility can ensue when hybridization brings together gene products that no longer function properly together in the same genome, thus reducing gene flow among incompatible genotypes.In plants, numerous forms of postzygotic genetic incompatibilities exist, including hybrid sterility, cytoplasmic male sterility and hybrid necrosis or weakness.Hybrid necrosis is a common type of incompatibility found in F1 progeny of many crosses within species and between species, which suggests it could be a model for understanding factors that are important at various stages in the processes of genetic differentiation, and perhaps speciation.Classical and newly described cases of hybrid necrosis generally involve two-locus interactions that are similar to Dobzhansky–Muller interactions. The observation that hybrid necrosis is characterized by a recurring suite of characteristics that are similar to phenotypes associated with oxidative stress, such as yellowing, wilting, cell death and tissue necrosis, in multiple taxa, indicates a common underlying mechanism might be responsible.Hybrid necrosis has been described many times during the past 80 years; one common theme that has emerged is a strong association between hybrid necrosis and selection for disease resistance, which suggest that causal alleles might evolve repeatedly in response to common external pressures, such as host–pathogen conflict.In one case of mild autonecrosis, the causal genes have been identified; one is a disease-resistance (R) gene, implicating this diverse and rapidly evolving class of genes in plant hybrid incompatibility, and suggesting that hybrid necrosis is akin to an autoimmune response.Other types of hybrid failure that are due to F1 weakness in plants might be caused by factors as varied as stresses in the physical environment, hormonal aberrations and genome-integrated viruses.Identifying the evolutionary pressures that contribute to divergence or genetic incompatibility remains an important goal with implications for speciation, and hybrid necrosis, given its prevalence in the plant kingdom, could provide a particularly good model for understanding such processes.",

This paper investigates the feasibility of using visible/near infrared hyperspectral data collected with a miniaturized NIR spectrometer to identify cultivars of barley, chickpea and sorghum in the context of Ethiopia. A total of 2650 grains of barley, chickpea and sorghum cultivars were scanned using the SCIO, a recently released miniaturized NIR spectrometer. The effects of data preprocessing techniques and choosing a machine learning algorithm on distinguishing cultivars are further evaluated. Predictive multiclass models of 24 barley cultivars, 19 chickpea cultivars and 10 sorghum cultivars delivered an accuracy of 89%, 96% and 87% on hold-out sample. The Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS-DA) algorithms consistently outperformed other algorithms. Several cultivars, believed to be widely adopted in Ethiopia, were identified with perfect accuracy. These results advance the discussion on cultivar identification survey methods by demonstrating that miniaturized NIR spectrometers represent a low-cost, rapid and viable tool. We further discuss the potential utility of the method for adoption surveys, field-scale agronomic studies, socio-economic impact assessments and value chain quality control. Finally, we provide a free tool for R to easily carry out crop cultivar identification and measure uncertainty based on spectral data.",

		"abstract": "Genomic selection - the prediction of breeding values using DNA polymorphisms - is a disruptive method that has widely been adopted by animal and plant breeders to increase productivity. It was recently shown that other sources of molecular variations such as those resulting from transcripts or metabolites could be used to accurately predict complex traits. These endophenotypes have the advantage of capturing the expressed genotypes and consequently the complex regulatory networks that occur in the different layers between the genome and the phenotype. However, obtaining such omics data at very large scales, such as those typically experienced in breeding, remains challenging. As an alternative, we proposed using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS) as a high-throughput, low cost and non-destructive tool to indirectly capture endophenotypic variants and compute relationship matrices for predicting complex traits, and coined this new approach ”phenomic selection” (PS). We tested PS on two species of economic interest (Triticum aestivum L. and Populus nigra L.) using NIRS on various tissues (grains, leaves, wood). We showed that one could reach predictions as accurate as with molecular markers, for developmental, tolerance and productivity traits, even in environments radically different from the one in which NIRS were collected. Our work constitutes a proof of concept and provides new perspectives for the breeding community, as PS is theoretically applicable to any organism at low cost and does not require any molecular information.",

		"abstract": "Hyperspectral reflectance phenotyping and genomic selection are two emerging technologies that have the potential to increase plant breeding efficiency by improving prediction accuracy for grain yield. Hyperspectral cameras quantify canopy reflectance across a wide range of wavelengths that are associated with numerous biophysical and biochemical processes in plants. Genomic selection models utilize genome-wide marker or pedigree information to predict the genetic values of breeding lines. In this study, we propose a multi-kernel GBLUP approach to genomic selection that uses genomic marker-, pedigree-, and hyperspectral reflectance-derived relationship matrices to model the genetic main effects and genotype × environment (G × E) interactions across environments within a bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) breeding program. We utilized an airplane equipped with a hyperspectral camera to phenotype five differentially managed treatments of the yield trials conducted by the Bread Wheat Improvement Program of the International Maize and Wheat Improvement Center (CIMMYT) at Ciudad Obregón, México over four breeding cycles. We observed that single-kernel models using hyperspectral reflectance-derived relationship matrices performed similarly or superior to marker- and pedigree-based genomic selection models when predicting within and across environments. Multi-kernel models combining marker/pedigree information with hyperspectral reflectance phentoypes had the highest prediction accuracies; however, improvements in accuracy over marker- and pedigree-based models were marginal when correcting for days to heading. Our results demonstrate the potential of using hyperspectral imaging to predict grain yield within a multi-environment context and also support further studies on the integration of hyperspectral reflectance phenotyping into breeding programs.",

Images were analyzed using Fiji image processing software and Microsoft Excel to create qualitative false color images and quantitative graphs to detect plant stress.\nConclusions: Stress was detected in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings within 15 min of salinity application using SI-NDVI analysis, before stress was visible. Stress was also observed during ammonium nitrate treatment of Eruca sativa plants before visual detection. Early detection of plant stress is possible using SI-NDVI imaging, which is both simpler to use and more cost efficient than traditional dual-image NDVI or hyper-spectral imaging.",

		"abstract": "To overcome the environmental changes occurring now and predicted for the future, it is essential that fruit breeders develop cultivars with better physiological performance. During the last few decades, high-throughput plant phenotyping and phenomics have been developed primarily in cereal breeding programs. In this study, plant reflectance, at the level of the leaf, was used to assess several physiological traits in five Vaccinium spp. cultivars growing under four controlled conditions (no-stress, water deficit, heat stress, and combined stress). Two modeling methodologies [Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) and Partial Least Squares (PLS)] with or without (W/O) prior wavelength selection (multicollinearity, genetic algorithms, or in combination) were considered. PLS generated better estimates than MLR, although prior wavelength selection improved MLR predictions. When data from the environments were combined, PLS W/O gave the best assessment for most of the traits, while in individual environments, the results varied according to the trait and methodology considered. The highest validation predictions were obtained for chlorophyll a/b (R2Val &le; 0.87), maximum electron transport rate (R2Val &le; 0.60), and the irradiance at which the electron transport rate is saturated (R2Val &le; 0.59). The results of this study, the first to model modulated chlorophyll fluorescence by reflectance, confirming the potential for implementing this tool in blueberry breeding programs, at least for the estimation of a number of important physiological traits. Additionally, the differential effects of the environment on the spectral signature of each cultivar shows this tool could be directly used to assess their tolerance to specific environments.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid zones have the potential to shed light on evolutionary processes driving adaptation and speciation. Secondary contact hybrid zones are particularly powerful natural systems for studying the interaction between divergent genomes to understand the mode and rate at which reproductive isolation accumulates during speciation. We have studied a total of 720 plants belonging to five populations from two Erysimum (Brassicaceae) species presenting a contact zone in the Sierra Nevada mountains (SE Spain). The plants were phenotyped in 2007 and 2017, and most of them were genotyped the first year using 10 microsatellite markers. Plants coming from natural populations were grown in a common garden to evaluate the reproductive barriers between both species by means of controlled crosses. All the plants used for the field and greenhouse study were characterized by measuring traits related to plant size and flower size. We estimated the genetic molecular variances, the genetic differentiation, and the genetic structure by means of the F-statistic and Bayesian inference. We also estimated the amount of recent gene flow between populations. We found a narrow unimodal hybrid zone where the hybrid genotypes appear to have been maintained by significant levels of a unidirectional gene flow coming from parental populations and from weak reproductive isolation between them. Hybrid plants exhibited intermediate or vigorous phenotypes depending on the analyzed trait. The phenotypic differences between the hybrid and the parental plants were highly coherent between the field and controlled cross experiments and through time. The highly coherent results obtained by combining field, experimental, and genetic data demonstrate the existence of a stable and narrow unimodal hybrid zone between Erysimum mediohispanicum and Erysimum nevadense at the high elevation of the Sierra Nevada mountains.",

Vegetation function can be assessed by examining dynamic processes and by evaluating plant traits, which themselves are dynamic. Using both trait-based and process-based approaches, spectroscopy can assess vegetation function at multiple scales using a variety of sensors and platforms ranging from proximal to airborne and satellite measurements. Since spectroscopic data are defined by the instruments and platforms available, along with their corresponding spatial, temporal and spectral scales, and since these scales may not always match those of the function of interest, consideration of scale is a necessary focus.

However, a direct relationship between phylogenetic affiliation and foliar reflectance spectra of species has not been established. We sought to develop this relationship by quantifying the extent to which underlying patterns of phylogenetic structure drive interspecific variation among foliar reflectance spectra within three Neotropical canopy tree communities with varying levels of soil fertility. We interpreted the resulting spectral patterns of phylogenetic signal in the context of foliar biochemical traits that may contribute to the spectral-phylogenetic link. We utilized a multi-model ensemble to elucidate trait-spectral relationships, and quantified phylogenetic signal for spectral wavelengths and traits using Pagel’s lambda statistic. Foliar reflectance spectra showed evidence of phylogenetic influence primarily within the visible and shortwave infrared spectral regions. These regions were also selected by the multi-model ensemble as those most important to the quantitative prediction of several foliar biochemical traits. Patterns of phylogenetic organization of spectra and traits varied across sites and with soil fertility, indicative of the complex interactions between the environmental and phylogenetic controls underlying patterns of biodiversity.",

NIRS measures the absorption of light by organic molecules. Initially, a calibration model was developed for each study. An independent set with flies not involved in initial cross-validation was then used to validate the accuracy of each calibration model. Flies from the independent sets were correctly classified into Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila simulans with 94% and 82% accuracy, respectively, whereas flies were successfully classified by gender with accuracy greater than 90%. In the age grading test, correlation plots of the actual and predicted age for males and females of D. melanogaster and D. simulans were shown to be overlapping between the adjacent age groups. It is, however, possible to predict the age of flies as less than 9 days of age with 62–88% accuracy and flies that are equal to or older than 9 days of age with 91–98% accuracy. Finally, we used NIRS to detect the presence of Wolbachia in flies. Flies from the independent sets were successfully identified as infected or not infected with Wolbachia with approximately 90% accuracy. These results suggest that NIRS has the potential to quantify the species, gender, and presence of Wolbachia in fly populations. However, additional optimization of the protocol may be necessary before the technique can reliably estimate fly age.",

		"abstract": "DNA introgressed from one species into another is typically deleterious at many genomic loci in the recipient species. It is therefore purged by selection over time. Here, we use mathematical modeling and whole-genome simulations to study the influence of recombination on the purging of introgressed DNA. We find that aggregate recombination controls the genome-wide rate of purging in the first few generations after admixture, when purging is most rapid. Aggregate recombination is quantified by <img class=\"highwire-embed\" alt=\"Embedded Image\" src=\"https://www.biorxiv.org/sites/default/files/highwire/biorxiv/early/2021/09/04/846147/embed/inline-graphic-1.gif\"/>, the average recombination rate across all locus pairs, and analogous metrics. It is influenced by the number of crossovers (i.e., the map length) and their locations along chromosomes, and by the number of chromosomes and heterogeneity in their size. A comparative prediction of our analysis is that species with fewer chromosomes should purge introgressed DNA more profoundly, and therefore should exhibit a weaker genomic signal of historical introgression. With regard to patterns across the genome, we show that, in heterogametic species with autosomal recombination in both sexes, more purging is expected on sex chromosomes than on autosomes, all else equal. The opposite prediction holds for species without autosomal recombination in the heterogametic sex. Finally, we show that positive genomic correlations between local recombination rate and introgressed ancestry, as recently observed in several taxa, are likely driven not by recombination’s effect in unlinking neutral from deleterious introgressed alleles, but rather by its effect on the rate of purging of the deleterious alleles themselves.\nNote on this version An earlier version of this manuscript had two parts: (1) Calculations of the variance of genetic relatedness between individuals with particular pedigree relationships, taking into account the randomness of recombination and segregation in their pedigree.

		"abstract": "More accurate and precise phenotyping strategies are necessary to empower high-resolution linkage mapping and genome-wide association studies and for training genomic selection models in plant improvement. Within this framework, the objective of modern phenotyping is to increase the accuracy, precision and throughput of phenotypic estimation at all levels of biological organization while reducing costs and minimizing labor through automation, remote sensing, improved data integration and experimental design. Much like the efforts to optimize genotyping during the 1980s and 1990s, designing effective phenotyping initiatives today requires multi-faceted collaborations between biologists, computer scientists, statisticians and engineers. Robust phenotyping systems are needed to characterize the full suite of genetic factors that contribute to quantitative phenotypic variation across cells, organs and tissues, developmental stages, years, environments, species and research programs. Next-generation phenotyping generates significantly more data than previously and requires novel data management, access and storage systems, increased use of ontologies to facilitate data integration, and new statistical tools for enhancing experimental design and extracting biologically meaningful signal from environmental and experimental noise. To ensure relevance, the implementation of efficient and informative phenotyping experiments also requires familiarity with diverse germplasm resources, population structures, and target populations of environments. Today, phenotyping is quickly emerging as the major operational bottleneck limiting the power of genetic analysis and genomic prediction. The challenge for the next generation of quantitative geneticists and plant breeders is not only to understand the genetic basis of complex trait variation, but also to use that knowledge to efficiently synthesize twenty-first century crop varieties.",

		"abstract": "Gene flow tends to impede the accumulation of genetic divergence. Here, we determine the limits for the evolution of postzygotic reproductive isolation in a model of two populations that are connected by gene flow. We consider two selective mechanisms for the creation and maintenance of a genetic barrier: local adaptation leads to divergence among incipient species due to selection against migrants, and Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) reinforce the genetic barrier through selection against hybrids. In particular, we are interested in the maximum strength of the barrier under a limited amount of local adaptation, a challenge that many incipient species may initially face. We first confirm that with classical two-locus DMIs, the maximum amount of local adaptation is indeed a limit to the strength of a genetic barrier. However, with three or more loci and cryptic epistasis, this limit holds no longer. In particular, we identify a minimal configuration of three epistatically interacting mutations that is sufficient to confer strong reproductive isolation.\n\nThis article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Determining which forms of reproductive isolation have the biggest impact on the process of divergence is a major goal of speciation research. These barriers are often divided into those that affect the potential for hybridization (premating isolation), and those that occur after mating (postmating isolation), and much debate has surrounded the relative importance of these categories. Within the species Mimulus aurantiacus, red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes occur in the southwest corner of California, and a hybrid zone occurs where their ranges overlap. We show that premating barriers are exclusively responsible for isolation in this system, with both ecogeographic and pollinator isolation contributing significantly to total isolation. Postmating forms of reproductive isolation have little or no impact on gene flow, indicating that hybrids likely contribute to introgression at neutral loci. Analysis of molecular variation across thousands of restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) markers reveals that the genomes of these taxa are largely undifferentiated. However, structure analysis shows that these taxa are distinguishable genetically, likely due to the impact of loci underlying differentiated adaptive phenotypes. These data exhibit the power of divergent natural selection to maintain highly differentiated phenotypes in the face of gene flow during the early stages of speciation.",

		"abstract": "Speciation can be driven by the evolution of many forms of reproductive isolation. Comparative study is a powerful approach for elucidating the relative importance of individual isolating barriers in the speciation process. A recent contribution by Scopece and colleagues provides comparative data for two groups of deceptive pollination orchids and aims to test hypotheses about which forms of isolation are most important in the two clades. The authors compare pollinator isolation and postmating isolation between the two orchid groups, and conclude that food-deceptive orchid species have less isolation by pollinator specificity than sexually deceptive species, and that postmating isolation is more important in the food-deceptive clade. Although we find this approach to be novel and potentially powerful, these conclusions are called into question by the methods used to define and select species and quantify pollinator isolation. Definition and selection of taxa were performed in a biased manner that undermines the ability to infer general patterns of speciation. Furthermore, pollinator isolation was calculated inconsistently for the two groups under study, effectively nullifying the comparison.",

		"abstract": "Over 800 million people across the tropics rely on cassava as a major source of calories. While the root dry matter content (RDMC) of this starchy root crop is important for both producers and consumers, characterization of RDMC by traditional methods is time-consuming and laborious for breeding programs. Alternate phenotyping methods have been proposed but lack the accuracy, cost, or speed ultimately needed for cassava breeding programs. For this reason, we investigated the use of a low-cost, handheld NIR spectrometer for field-based RDMC prediction in cassava. Oven-dried measurements of RDMC were paired with 21,044 scans of roots of 376 diverse clones from 10 field trials in Nigeria and grouped into training and test sets based on cross-validation schemes relevant to plant breeding programs. Mean partial least squares regression model performance ranged from R2p = 0.62 - 0.89 for within-trial predictions, which is within the range achieved with laboratory-grade spectrometers in previous studies. Relative to other factors, model performance was highly impacted by the inclusion of samples from the same environment in both the training and test sets. Random forest variable importance analysis of root spectra revealed increased importance in a region previously identified as predictive of water content in plants (~950 - 990 nm). With appropriate model calibration, the tested spectrometer will allow for field-based collection of spectral data with a smartphone for accurate RDMC prediction and potentially other quality traits, a step that could be easily integrated into existing harvesting workflows of cassava breeding programs.\nCORE IDEASA low-cost, handheld near-infrared spectrometer was tested for phenotyping of cassava rootsPlant breeding-relevant cross-validation schemes were used for predictionsHigh prediction accuracies were achieved for cassava root dry matter contentA spectral region predictive of plant water content was identified as important",

One of the cameras has been modified to be sensitive to near-infrared radiation reflected by the vegetation, whereas the other one remains as a common RGB camera. In order to determine the health status of the crop, the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is computed in a developed software. Once the aerial imagery is obtained by the drone, it is processed to eliminate image distortions and insert specific metadata needed for generating the orthomosaics with the health information of the plant or soil of interest. Finally, the vegetation index will be computed from the visible and near-infrared orthomosaics for a better interpretation of the user.

Progress in the development of field-based high throughput phenotyping methods has advanced considerably in the last 10 years through technological progress in sensor development and high-performance computing. Here, we review recent advances in high throughput field phenotyping technologies designed to inform the genetics of quantitative traits, including crop yield and disease tolerance. Successful application of phenotyping platforms to advance crop breeding and identify and monitor disease requires: (1) high resolution of imaging and environmental sensors; (2) quality data products that facilitate computer vision, machine learning and GIS; (3) capacity infrastructure for data management and analysis; and (4) automated environmental data collection. Accelerated breeding for agriculturally relevant crop traits is key to the development of improved varieties and is critically dependent on high-resolution, high-throughput field-scale phenotyping technologies that can efficiently discriminate better performing lines within a larger population and across multiple environments.",

		"abstract": "Kenaf (Hibiscus cannabinus L.) is an industrial crop used as a raw material in various fields and is cultivated worldwide. Compared to high potential for its utilization, breeding sector is not vigorous partially due to laborous breeding procedure. Thus, efficient breeding methods are required for varieties that can adapt to various environments and obtain optimal production. For that, identifying kenaf’s characteristics is very important during the breeding process. Here, we investigated if RGB based vegetative index (VI) could be associated with traits for biomass. We used 20 varieties and germplasm of kenaf and RGB images taken with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) for field selection in early and late growth stage. In addition, measuring the stem diameter and the number of nodes confirmed whether the vegetative index value obtained from the RGB image could infer the actual plant biomass. Based on the results, it was confirmed that the individual surface area and estimated plant height, which were identified from the RGB image, had positive correlations with the stem diameter and node number, which are actual growth indicators of the rate of growth further, biomass could also be estimated based on this. Moreover, it is suggested that VIs have a high correlation with actual growth indicators; thus, the biomass of kenaf could be predicted. Interstingly, those traits showing high correlation in the late stage had very low correlations in the early stage. To sum up, the results in the current study suggest a more efficient breeding method by reducing labor and resources required for breeding selection by the use of RGB image analysis obtained by UAV. This means that considerable high-quality research could be performed even with a tight budget. Furthermore, this method could be applied to crop management, which is done with other vegetative indices using a multispectral camera.",

Modern agricultural technologies such as irrigation systems, ground mulching, and rainwater storage can prevent drought, but these are only temporary solutions. Understanding the physiological, biochemical, and molecular reactions of plants to drought stress is therefore urgent. The recent rapid development of genomics tools has led to an increasing interest in phenomics, i.e., the study of phenotypic plant traits. Among phenomic strategies, high-throughput phenotyping (HTP) is attracting increasing attention as a way to address the bottlenecks of genomic and phenomic studies. HTP provides researchers a non-destructive and non-invasive method yet accurate in analyzing large-scale phenotypic data. This review describes plant responses to drought stress and introduces HTP methods that can detect changes in plant phenotypes in response to drought.",

Imaging applications are discussed in relation to both field and glasshouse-based plants, and techniques are sectioned into ‘healthy and diseased plant classification’ with an emphasis on classification accuracy, early detection of stress, and disease severity. A central focus of the review is the use of hyperspectral imaging and how this is being utilised to find additional information about plant health, and the ability to predict onset of disease. A summary of techniques used to detect biotic and abiotic stress in plants is presented, including the level of accuracy associated with each method.",

		"abstract": "The outcome of secondary contact between divergent lineages or species may be influenced by both the reproductive traits of parental species and the fitness of offspring; however, their relative contributions have rarely been evaluated, particularly in longer-lived vertebrate species. We performed pure and reciprocal laboratory crosses between Ctenophorus decresii (tawny dragon) and C. modestus (swift dragon) to examine how parental reproductive traits and ecologically relevant offspring fitness traits may explain contact zone dynamics in the wild. The two species meet in a contact zone of post-F1 hybrids with asymmetric backcrossing and predominantly C. modestus mtDNA haplotypes. We found no evidence for reduced parental fecundity or offspring fitness for F1 hybrid crosses. However, maternal reproductive strategy differed between species, irrespective of the species of their mate. Ctenophorus modestus females had higher fecundity and produced more and larger clutches with lower embryonic mortality. Parental species also influenced sex ratios and offspring traits, with C. modestus ♀ × C. decresii ♂ hybrids exhibiting higher trait values for more fitness measures (growth rate, sprint speed, bite force) than offspring from all other pairings. Together, these patterns are consistent with the prevalence of C. modestus mtDNA in the contact zone, and asymmetric backcrossing likely reflects fitness effects that manifest in the F2 generation. Our results highlight how parental species can influence multiple offspring traits in different ways, which together may combine to influence offspring fitness and shape contact zone dynamics.",

Automated on-the-go mapping of plant stress would allow for a timely intervention and mitigation of the problem before critical thresholds were exceeded, thereby maximizing productivity. The spectral signature of plant leaves was analyzed by a hyperspectral camera to identify the onset and intensity of plant water stress. Five different levels of water treatment were created in young apple trees (cv. ‘Buckeye Gala’) in a greenhouse. The trees were periodically monitored with a hyperspectral camera along with an active-illuminated spectral vegetation sensor and a digital color camera. Individual spectral images over a 385–1000 nm wavelength range were extracted at a speciﬁc wavelength to estimate reﬂectance and generate spectral proﬁles for the ﬁve different water treatment levels. Various spectral indices were calculated and correlated to stress levels. The highest correlation was found with Red Edge NDVI at 705 and 750 nm in narrowband indices and NDVI at 680 and 800 nm in broadband indices. The experimental results indicated that intelligent optical sensors could deliver decision support for plant stress detection and management.",

		"abstract": "The impact of biodiversity loss on the functioning of ecosystems and their ability to provide ecological services has become a central issue in ecology. Several experiments have provided evidence that reduced species diversity may impair ecosystem processes such as plant biomass production1,2,3,4,5. The interpretation of these experiments, however, has been controversial6,7,8,9,10,11,12 because two types of mechanism may operate in combination6,13,14,15. In the ‘selection effect’, dominance by species with particular traits affects ecosystem processes. In the ‘complementarity effect’, resource partitioning or positive interactions lead to increased total resource use. Here we present a new approach to separate the two effects on the basis of an additive partitioning analogous to the Price equation in evolutionary genetics16,17,18,19. Applying this method to data from the pan-European BIODEPTH experiment4 reveals that the selection effect is zero on average and varies from negative to positive in different localities, depending on whether species with lower- or higher-than-average biomass dominate communities. In contrast, the complementarity effect is positive overall, supporting the hypothesis that plant diversity influences primary production in European grasslands through niche differentiation or facilitation.",

		"abstract": "The leaf economics spectrum (LES) provides a useful framework for examining species strategies as shaped by their evolutionary history. However, that spectrum, as originally described, involved only two key resources (carbon and nutrients) and one of three economically important plant organs. Herein, I evaluate whether the economics spectrum idea can be broadly extended to water – the third key resource –stems, roots and entire plants and to individual, community and ecosystem scales. My overarching hypothesis is that strong selection along trait trade-off axes, in tandem with biophysical constraints, results in convergence for any taxon on a uniformly fast, medium or slow strategy (i.e. rates of resource acquisition and processing) for all organs and all resources. Evidence for economic trait spectra exists for stems and roots as well as leaves, and for traits related to water as well as carbon and nutrients. These apply generally within and across scales (within and across communities, climate zones, biomes and lineages). There are linkages across organs and coupling among resources, resulting in an integrated whole-plant economics spectrum. Species capable of moving water rapidly have low tissue density, short tissue life span and high rates of resource acquisition and flux at organ and individual scales. The reverse is true for species with the slow strategy. Different traits may be important in different conditions, but as being fast in one respect generally requires being fast in others, being fast or slow is a general feature of species. Economic traits influence performance and fitness consistent with trait-based theory about underlying adaptive mechanisms. Traits help explain differences in growth and survival across resource gradients and thus help explain the distribution of species and the assembly of communities across light, water and nutrient gradients. Traits scale up – fast traits are associated with faster rates of ecosystem processes such as decomposition or primary productivity, and slow traits with slow process rates. Synthesis. Traits matter. A single ‘fast–slow’ plant economics spectrum that integrates across leaves, stems and roots is a key feature of the plant universe and helps to explain individual ecological strategies, community assembly processes and the functioning of ecosystems.",

Although many studies have addressed large-effect genetic footprints in the advanced stages of speciation, the genetics of reproductive isolation in nascent stage of speciation remains unclear. Here, we show that pig domestication offers an interesting model for studying the early stages of speciation in great details. Pig breeds have not evolved the large X-effect of hybrid incompatibility commonly observed between “good species.” Instead, deleterious epistatic interactions among multiple autosomal loci are common. These weak Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities confer partial hybrid inviability with sex biases in crosses between European and East Asian domestic pigs. The genomic incompatibility is enriched in pathways for angiogenesis, androgen receptor signaling and immunity, with an observation of many highly differentiated cis-regulatory variants. Our study suggests that partial hybrid inviability caused by pervasive but weak interactions among autosomal loci may be a hallmark of nascent speciation in mammals.",

Because hybrid incompatibilities are caused by divergence in each of the hybridizing species, they also reveal genomic changes occurring on short evolutionary time scales that have functional consequences. These changes include divergence in protein-coding gene sequence, structure, and location, as well as divergence in noncoding DNAs. The most important unresolved issue is understanding the evolutionary causes of the divergence within species that in turn leads to incompatibility between species. Surprisingly, much of this divergence does not appear to be driven by ecological adaptation but may instead result from responses to purely mutational mechanisms or to internal genetic conﬂicts.",

Tests of one important prediction from this model, that incompatibilities “snowball,” have relied on comparisons of the number of incompatibilities between closely related pairs of species separated by different divergence times. How incompatibilities accumulate along phylogenies, however, remains poorly understood. We extend the Dobzhansky–Muller model to multispecies clades to describe the mathematical relationship between tree topology and the number of shared incompatibilities among related pairs of species. We use these results to develop a statistical test that distinguishes between the snowball and alternative incompatibility accumulation models, including nonepistatic and multilocus incompatibility models, in a phylogenetic context. We further demonstrate that patterns of incompatibility sharing across species pairs can be used to estimate the relative frequencies of different types of incompatibilities, including derived–derived versus derived–ancestral incompatibilities. Our results and statistical methods should motivate comparative genetic mapping of hybrid incompatibilities to evaluate competing models of speciation.",

		"abstract": "Resistance responses that plants deploy in defence against pathogens are often triggered following a recognition event mediated by resistance (R) genes. The encoded R proteins usually contain a nucleotide-binding site (NB) and a leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain. They are further classified into those that contain an N-terminal coiled coil (CC) motif or a Toll interleukin receptor (TIR) domain. Such R genes, when transferred into a susceptible plant of the same or closely related species, usually impart full resistance capability. We have used map-based cloning and mutation analysis to study the recognition of Peronospora parasitica (RPP)2 (At) locus in Arabidopsis accession Columbia (Col-0), which is a determinant of specific recognition of P. parasitica (At) isolate Cala2. Genetic mapping located RPP2 to a 200-kb interval on chromosome 4, which contained four adjacent TIR:NB:LRR genes. Mutational analysis revealed three classes of genes involved in specifying resistance to Cala2. One class, which resulted in pleiotropic effects on resistance to other P. parasitica (At) isolates, was unlinked to the RPP2 locus; this class included AtSGT1b. The other two classes were mapped within the interval and were specific to Cala2 resistance. Representatives of each of these classes were sequenced, and mutations were found in one or the other of two (RPP2A and RPP2B) of the four TIR:NB:LRR genes. RPP2A and RPP2B complemented their specific mutations, but failed to impart resistance when present alone, and it is concluded that both genes are essential determinants for isolate-specific recognition of Cala2. RPP2A has an unusual structure with a short LRR domain at the C-terminus, preceded by two potential but incomplete TIR:NB domains. In addition, the RPP2A LRR domain lacks conserved motifs found in all but three other TIR:NB:LRR class proteins. In contrast, RPP2B has a complete TIR:NB:LRR structure. It is concluded that RPP2A and RPP2B cooperate to specify Cala2 resistance by providing recognition or signalling functions lacked by either partner protein.",

		"abstract": "Background:  In order to maintain high yields while saving water and preserving non-renewable resources and thus limiting the use of chemical fertilizer, it is crucial to select plants with more efficient root systems. This could be achieved through an optimization of both root architecture and root uptake ability and/or through the improvement of positive plant interactions with microorganisms in the rhizosphere. The development of devices suitable for highthroughput phenotyping of root structures remains a major bottleneck.\nResults:  Rhizotrons suitable for plant growth in controlled conditions and non-invasive image acquisition of plant shoot and root systems (RhizoTubes) are described. These RhizoTubes allow growing one to six plants simultaneously, having a maximum height of 1.1 m, up to 8 weeks, depending on plant species. Both shoot and root compartment can be imaged automatically and non-destructively throughout the experiment thanks to an imaging cabin (Rhizo‑Cab). RhizoCab contains robots and imaging equipment for obtaining high-resolution pictures of plant roots. Using this versatile experimental setup, we illustrate how some morphometric root traits can be determined for various species including model (Medicago truncatula), crops (Pisum sativum, Brassica napus, Vitis vinifera, Triticum aestivum) and weed (Vulpia myuros) species grown under non-limiting conditions or submitted to various abiotic and biotic constraints. The measurement of the root phenotypic traits using this system was compared to that obtained using “classic” growth conditions in pots.\nConclusions:  This integrated system, to include 1200 Rhizotubes, will allow high-throughput phenotyping of plant shoots and roots under various abiotic and biotic environmental conditions. Our system allows an easy visualization or extraction of roots and measurement of root traits for high-throughput or kinetic analyses. The utility of this system for studying root system architecture will greatly facilitate the identification of genetic and environmental determi‑nants of key root traits involved in crop responses to stresses, including interactions with soil microorganisms.",

		"abstract": "Many prey species have evolved collective responses to avoid predation. They rapidly transfer information about potential predators to trigger and coordinate escape waves. Predation avoidance behaviour is often manipulated by trophically transmitted parasites, to facilitate their transmission to the next host. We hypothesized that the presence of infected, behaviourally altered individuals might disturb the spread of escape waves. We used the tapeworm\n              Schistocephalus solidus\n              , which increases risk-taking behaviour and decreases social responsiveness of its host, the three-spined stickleback, to test this hypothesis. Three subgroups of sticklebacks were placed next to one another in separate compartments with shelter. The middle subgroup contained either uninfected or infected sticklebacks. We confronted an outer subgroup with an artificial bird strike and studied how the escape response spread through the subgroups. With uninfected sticklebacks in the middle, escape waves spread rapidly through the entire shoal and fish remained in shelter thereafter. With infected sticklebacks in the middle, the escape wave was disrupted and uninfected fish rarely used the shelter. Infected individuals can disrupt the transmission of flight responses, thereby not only increasing their own predation risk but also that of their uninfected shoal members. Our study uncovers a potentially far-reaching fitness consequence of grouping with infected individuals.",

		"abstract": "Senescence is usually viewed as increased age-specific mortality or decreased age-specific fecundity due to the declining ability of natural selection to remove deleterious age-specific mutations with age. In herbaceous perennial plants, trends in age-specific mortality are often confounded by size. Age-indeterminate senescence, where accumulated physiological damage varies strongly with environment, may be a better model of senescence in these species. We analysed trends in size and fertility in Plantago lanceolata, using a long-term demographic census involving > 10 years and > 8000 individuals in four cohorts. We used elasticity and pairwise invasion analysis of life-history function parameterized age × stage matrices to assess whether the force of natural selection declined with age. Then, we used reverse age analysis of size and fertility to assess whether age-indeterminate senescence occurred. Reverse age analysis uses longitudinal data for individuals that have died to look at trait patterns as a function of both age and remaining time to death. We hypothesized that (i) the strength of natural selection would decline strongly with age, and (ii) physiological condition would deteriorate for several years prior to death. Both elasticity and invasion analyses suggested that the strength of natural selection through mortality declined strongly with age once size was accounted for. Further, reverse age analyses showed that individuals shrank for 3 years prior to death, suggesting physiological decline. Inflorescence production declined with age, and also declined in the 3 years prior to death regardless of overall age. Synthesis. The hypothesis that plants escape senescence generally assumes that plants can continue to grow larger and increase reproduction as they get older. The results here show that size and reproduction decline with age and the rates of these declines towards death are life span- and age dependent. Further research is needed to delineate the importance of age-determinate vs. age-indeterminate factors in senescence patterns across species.",

		"abstract": "The magnitude and genetic basis of local adaptation is of fundamental interest in evolutionary biology. However, field experiments usually do not consider early life stages, and therefore may underestimate local adaptation and miss genetically based tradeoffs. We examined the contribution of differences in seedling establishment to adaptive differentiation and the genetic architecture of local adaptation using recombinant inbred lines (RIL) derived from a cross between two locally adapted populations (Italy and Sweden) of the annual plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We planted freshly matured, dormant seeds (>180 000) representing >200 RILs at the native field sites of the parental genotypes, estimated the strength of selection during different life stages, mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness and its components, and quantified selection on seed dormancy. We found that selection during the seedling establishment phase contributed strongly to the fitness advantage of the local genotype at both sites. With one exception, local alleles of the eight distinct establishment QTL were favored. The major QTL for establishment and total fitness showed evidence of a fitness tradeoff and was located in the same region as the major seed dormancy QTL and the dormancy gene DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 (DOG1). RIL seed dormancy could explain variation in seedling establishment and fitness across the life cycle. Our results demonstrate that genetically based differences in traits affecting performance during early life stages can contribute strongly to adaptive differentiation and genetic tradeoffs, and should be considered for a full understanding of the ecology and genetics of local adaptation.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid incompatibilities are a common correlate of genomic divergence and a potentially important contributor to reproductive isolation. However, we do not yet have a detailed understanding of how hybrid incompatibility loci function and evolve within their native species, or why they are dysfunctional in hybrids. Here, we explore these issues for a well-studied, two-locus hybrid incompatibility between hybrid male sterility 1 (hms1) and hybrid male sterility 2 (hms2) in the closely related yellow monkeyflower species Mimulus guttatus and M. nasutus. By performing reciprocal backcrosses with introgression lines (ILs), we find evidence for gametic expression of the hms1-hms2 incompatibility. Surprisingly, however, hybrid transmission ratios at hms1 do not reflect this incompatibility, suggesting that additional mechanisms counteract the effects of gametic sterility. Indeed, our backcross experiment shows hybrid transmission bias toward M. guttatus through both pollen and ovules, an effect that is particularly strong when hms2 is homozygous for M. nasutus alleles. In contrast, we find little evidence for hms1 transmission bias in crosses within M. guttatus, providing no indication of selfish evolution at this locus. Although we do not yet have sufficient genetic resolution to determine if hybrid sterility and transmission ratio distortion (TRD) map to the same loci, our preliminary fine-mapping uncovers a genetically independent hybrid lethality system involving at least two loci linked to hms1. This fine-scale dissection of TRD at hms1 and hms2 provides insight into genomic differentiation between closely related Mimulus species and reveals multiple mechanisms of hybrid dysfunction.",

The classical view is that adaptive mutations are nearly infinite in number with infinitesimally small phenotypic effect3, but recent theory suggests otherwise4. To provide empirical estimates of the magnitude of adaptive mutations in wild plants, we conducted field studies to determine the adaptive value of alternative alleles at a single locus, YELLOW UPPER5,6,7 (YUP). YUP controls the presence or absence of yellow carotenoid pigments in the petals of pink-flowered Mimulus lewisii, which is pollinated by bumblebees5,8,9,10, and its red-flowered sister species11 M. cardinalis, which is pollinated by hummingbirds5,8,9,10. We bred near-isogenic lines (NILs) in which the YUP allele from each species was substituted into the other. M. cardinalis NILs with the M. lewisii YUP allele had dark pink flowers and received 74-fold more bee visits than the wild type, whereas M. lewisii NILs with the M. cardinalis yup allele had yellow-orange flowers and received 68-fold more hummingbird visits than the wild type. These results indicate that an adaptive shift in pollinator preference may be initiated by a single major mutation.",

Abundant evidence shows that these hybrid fitness problems are caused by incompatible interactions between loci: new alleles that become established in one species are sometimes functionally incompatible with alleles at interacting loci from another species. However, almost nothing is known about the genes involved in such hybrid incompatibilities or the evolutionary forces that drive their divergence. Here we identify a gene that causes epistatic inviability in hybrids between two fruitfly species, Drosophila melanogaster and D. simulans. Our population genetic analysis reveals that this gene—which encodes a nuclear pore protein—evolved by positive natural selection in both species' lineages. These results show that a lethal hybrid incompatibility has evolved as a by-product of adaptive protein evolution.",

		"abstract": "Genetic variation for quantitative traits is often greater than that expected to be maintained by mutation in the face of purifying natural selection. One possible explanation for this observed variation is the action of heterogeneous natural selection in the wild. Here we report that selection on quantitative trait loci (QTL) for fitness traits in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana differs among natural ecological settings and genetic backgrounds. At one QTL, the allele that enhanced the viability of fall-germinating seedlings in North Carolina reduced the fecundity of spring-germinating seedlings in Rhode Island. Several other QTL experienced strong directional selection, but only in one site and seasonal cohort. Thus, different loci were exposed to selection in different natural environments. Selection on allelic variation also depended upon the genetic background. The allelic fitness effects of two QTL reversed direction depending on the genotype at the other locus. Moreover, alternative alleles at each of these loci caused reversals in the allelic fitness effects of a QTL closely linked to TFL1, a candidate developmental gene displaying nucleotide sequence polymorphism consistent with balancing selection. Thus, both environmental heterogeneity and epistatic selection may maintain genetic variation for fitness in wild plant species.",

		"abstract": "Closely related species with parapatric elevational ranges are ubiquitous in tropical mountains worldwide. The gradient speciation hypothesis proposes that these series are the result of in situ ecological speciation driven by divergent selection across elevation. Direct tests of this scenario have been hampered by the difficulty inferring the geographic arrangement of populations at the time of divergence. In cichlids, sticklebacks and Timema stick insects, support for ecological speciation driven by other selective pressures has come from demonstrating parallel speciation, where divergence proceeds independently across replicated environmental gradients. Here, we take advantage of the unique geography of the island of New Guinea to test for parallel gradient speciation in replicated populations of Syma kingfishers that show extremely subtle differentiation across elevation and between historically isolated mountain ranges. We find that currently described high-elevation and low-elevation species have reciprocally monophyletic gene trees and form nuclear DNA clusters, rejecting this hypothesis. However, demographic modelling suggests selection has likely maintained species boundaries in the face of gene flow following secondary contact. We compile evidence from the published literature to show that although in situ gradient speciation in labile organisms such as birds appears rare, divergent selection and post-speciation gene flow may be an underappreciated force in the origin of elevational series and tropical beta diversity along mountain slopes.",

		"abstract": "The endosperm is a developmental innovation of angiosperms that supports embryo growth and germination. Aside from this essential reproductive function, the endosperm fuels angiosperm evolution by rapidly establishing reproductive barriers between incipient species. Specifically, the endosperm prevents hybridization of newly formed polyploids with their non-polyploid progenitors, a phenomenon termed the triploid block. Furthermore, recently diverged diploid species are frequently reproductively isolated by endosperm-based hybridization barriers. Current genetic approaches have revealed a prominent role for epigenetic processes establishing these barriers. In particular, imprinted genes, which are expressed in a parent-of-origin-specific manner, underpin the interploidy barrier in the model species\n              Arabidopsis\n              . We will discuss the mechanisms establishing hybridization barriers in the endosperm, the driving forces for these barriers and their impact for angiosperm evolution.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘How does epigenetics influence the course of evolution?’",

		"abstract": "Intrinsic postzygotic barriers can play an important and multifaceted role in speciation, but their contribution is often thought to be reserved to the final stages of the speciation process. Here, we review how intrinsic postzygotic barriers can contribute to speciation, and how this role may change through time. We outline three major contributions of intrinsic postzygotic barriers to speciation. (i)\n              reduction of gene flow\n              : intrinsic postzygotic barriers can effectively reduce gene exchange between sympatric species pairs. We discuss the factors that influence how effective incompatibilities are in limiting gene flow. (ii)\n              early onset of species boundaries via rapid evolution\n              : intrinsic postzygotic barriers can evolve between recently diverged populations or incipient species, thereby influencing speciation relatively early in the process. We discuss why the early origination of incompatibilities is expected under some biological models, and detail how other (and often less obvious) incompatibilities may also serve as important barriers early on in speciation. (iii)\n              reinforcement\n              : intrinsic postzygotic barriers can promote the evolution of subsequent reproductive isolation through processes such as reinforcement, even between relatively recently diverged species pairs. We incorporate classic and recent empirical and theoretical work to explore these three facets of intrinsic postzygotic barriers, and provide our thoughts on recent challenges and areas in the field in which progress can be made.\n            \n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive barriers perform a vital role during speciation. Hybrid weakness, the poorer development of hybrids compared with their parents, hinders gene exchange between different species at the postzygotic stage. Here we show that two incompatible dominant loci (Hwi1 and Hwi2) involving three genes are likely to determine the high temperature-dependent expression of hybrid weakness in interspecific hybrids of rice. Hwi1 comprises two leucine-rich repeat receptor-like kinase (LRR–RLK) genes, 25L1 and 25L2, which are specific to wild rice (Oryza rufipogon) and induce hybrid weakness. Hwi2, a rare allele that is predominantly distributed in indica rice (Oryza sativa), encodes a secreted putative subtilisin-like protease. Functional analysis indicated that pyramiding of Hwi1 and Hwi2 activates the autoimmune response in the basal nodes of hybrids, interrupting root formation and then impairing shoot growth. These findings bring new insights into our understanding of reproductive isolation and may benefit rice breeding.",

		"abstract": "In the course of generating populations of maize with teosinte chromosomal introgressions, an unusual sickly plant phenotype was noted in individuals from crosses with two teosinte accessions collected near Valle de Bravo, Mexico. The plants of these Bravo teosinte accessions appear phenotypically normal themselves and the F1 plants appear similar to typical maize × teosinte F1s. However, upon backcrossing to maize, the BC1 and subsequent generations display a number of detrimental characteristics including shorter stature, reduced seed set, and abnormal floral structures. This phenomenon is observed in all BC individuals and there is no chromosomal segment linked to the sickly plant phenotype in advanced backcross generations. Once the sickly phenotype appears in a lineage, normal plants are never again recovered by continued backcrossing to the normal maize parent. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing reveals a small number of genomic sequences, some with homology to transposable elements, that have increased in copy number in the backcross populations. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings, which do not have striking phenotypic abnormalities, identified segments of 18 maize genes that exhibit increased expression in sickly plants. A de novo assembly of transcripts present in plants exhibiting the sickly phenotype identified a set of 59 upregulated novel transcripts. These transcripts include some examples with sequence similarity to transposable elements and other sequences present in the recurrent maize parent (W22) genome as well as novel sequences not present in the W22 genome. Genome-wide profiles of gene expression, DNA methylation, and small RNAs are similar between sickly plants and normal controls, although a few upregulated transcripts and transposable elements are associated with altered small RNA or methylation profiles. This study documents hybrid incompatibility and genome instability triggered by the backcrossing of Bravo teosinte with maize. We name this phenomenon “hybrid decay” and present ideas on the mechanism that may underlie it.",

		"abstract": "The genomic architecture of functionally important traits is key to understanding the maintenance of reproductive barriers and trait differences when divergent populations or species hybridize. We conducted a genome-wide association study (GWAS) to study trait architecture in natural hybrids of two ecologically divergent Populus species. We genotyped 472 seedlings from a natural hybrid zone of Populus alba and Populus tremula for genome-wide markers from reduced representation sequencing, phenotyped the plants in common gardens for 46 phytochemical (phenylpropanoid), morphological and growth traits, and used a Bayesian polygenic model for mapping. We detected three classes of genomic architectures: traits with finite, detectable associations of genetic loci with phenotypic variation in addition to highly polygenic heritability; traits with indications for polygenic heritability only; and traits with no detectable heritability. For the first class, we identified genome regions with plausible candidate genes for phenylpropanoid biosynthesis or its regulation, including MYB transcription factors and glycosyl transferases. GWAS in natural, recombinant hybrids represent a promising step towards resolving the genomic architecture of phenotypic traits in long-lived species. This facilitates the fine-mapping and subsequent functional characterization of genes and networks causing differences in hybrid performance and fitness.",

		"abstract": "Many recent studies have addressed the mechanisms operating during the early stages of speciation, but surprisingly few studies have tested theoretical predictions on the evolution of strong reproductive isolation (RI). To help address this gap, we first undertook a quantitative review of the hybrid zone literature for flowering plants in relation to reproductive barriers. Then, using Populus as an exemplary model group, we analysed genome-wide variation for phylogenetic tree topologies in both early- and late-stage speciation taxa to determine how these patterns may be related to the genomic architecture of RI. Our plant literature survey revealed variation in barrier complexity and an association between barrier number and introgressive gene flow. Focusing on Populus, our genome-wide analysis of tree topologies in speciating poplar taxa points to unusually complex genomic architectures of RI, consistent with earlier genome-wide association studies. These architectures appear to facilitate the 'escape' of introgressed genome segments from polygenic barriers even with strong RI, thus affecting their relationships with recombination rates. Placed within the context of the broader literature, our data illustrate how phylogenomic approaches hold great promise for addressing the evolution and temporary breakdown of RI during late stages of speciation. This article is part of the theme issue 'Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers'.",

These two species are highly diverged genetically [Fst between pure species, based on 50K single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) = 0.532] and phenotypically: pure red have on average twice the carcass mass of pure sika in our sample (38.7 kg vs 19.1 kg). After controlling for sex, age, and population genetic structure, we found 10 autosomal genomic locations with QTL for carcass mass. Effect sizes ranged from 0.191 to 1.839 kg and as expected, in all cases the allele derived from sika conferred lower carcass mass. The sika population was fixed for all small carcass mass alleles, whereas the red deer population was typically polymorphic. GO term analysis of genes lying in the QTL regions are associated with oxygen transport. Although body mass is a likely target of selection, none of the SNPs marking QTL are introgressing faster or slower than expected in either direction.",

		"abstract": "Genetic variation segregates as linked sets of variants or haplotypes. Haplotypes and linkage are central to genetics and underpin virtually all genetic and selection analysis. Yet, genomic data often omit haplotype information due to constraints in sequencing technologies. Here, we present \"haplotagging,\" a simple, low-cost linked-read sequencing technique that allows sequencing of hundreds of individuals while retaining linkage information. We apply haplotagging to construct megabase-size haplotypes for over 600 individual butterflies (Heliconius erato and H. melpomene), which form overlapping hybrid zones across an elevational gradient in Ecuador. Haplotagging identifies loci controlling distinctive high- and lowland wing color patterns. Divergent haplotypes are found at the same major loci in both species, while chromosome rearrangements show no parallelism. Remarkably, in both species, the geographic clines for the major wing-pattern loci are displaced by 18 km, leading to the rise of a novel hybrid morph in the center of the hybrid zone. We propose that shared warning signaling (Müllerian mimicry) may couple the cline shifts seen in both species and facilitate the parallel coemergence of a novel hybrid morph in both comimetic species. Our results show the power of efficient haplotyping methods when combined with large-scale sequencing data from natural populations.",

		"abstract": "Identifying the genetic bases for colour patterns has provided important insights into the control and expression of pigmentation and how these characteristics influence fitness. However, much more is known about the genetic bases for traits based on melanin pigments than for traits based on another major class of pigments, carotenoids. Here, we use natural admixture in a hybrid zone between Audubon's and myrtle warblers (Setophaga coronata auduboni/S. c. coronata) to identify genomic regions associated with both types of pigmentation. Warblers are known for rapid speciation and dramatic differences in plumage. For each of five plumage coloration traits, we found highly significant associations with multiple single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome and these were clustered in discrete regions. Regions near significantly associated SNPs were enriched for genes associated with keratin filaments, fibrils that make up feathers. A carotenoid-based trait that differs between the taxa-throat colour-had more than a dozen genomic regions of association. One cluster of SNPs for this trait overlaps the Scavenger Receptor Class F Member 2 (SCARF2) gene. Other scavenger receptors are presumed to be expressed at target tissues and involved in the selective movement of carotenoids into the target cells, making SCARF2 a plausible new candidate for carotenoid processing. In addition, two melanin-based plumage traits-colours of the eye line and eye spot-show very strong associations with a single genomic region mapping to chromosome 20 in the zebra finch. These findings indicate that only a subset of the genomic regions differentiated between these two warblers are associated with the plumage differences between them and demonstrate the utility of reduced-representation genomic scans in hybrid zones.",

In the Mimulus tilingii species complex, three species (M. caespitosa, M. minor, and M. tilingii) are largely allopatric and grow exclusively at high elevations (>2000 m). The extent to which geographic separation has shaped patterns of divergence among the species is not well understood. In this study, we determined that the three species are morphologically and genetically distinct, yet recently diverged. Additionally, we performed reciprocal crosses within and between the species and identified several strong postzygotic reproductive barriers, including hybrid seed inviability, F1 hybrid necrosis, and F1 hybrid male and female sterility. In this study, such postzygotic barriers are so strong that a cross between any species pair in the M. tilingii complex would cause nearly complete reproductive isolation. We consider how geographical and topographical patterns may have facilitated the evolution of several postzygotic barriers and contributed to speciation of closely related members within the M. tilingii species complex.",

In this study, we describe the genomic variation among three temperate japonica rice (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica) varieties 'Aranghyangchalbyeo' ('CH7'), 'Sanghaehyangheolua' ('CH8') and 'Shinseonchalbyeo' ('CH9'), carrying different hybrid weakness genes. The reciprocal progeny obtained from crossing any two varieties displayed characteristic hybrid weakness traits. We mapped and cloned a new locus, Hwc3 (hybrid weakness 3), on chromosome 4. Sequence analysis identified that a long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon was inserted into the promoter region of the Hwc3 gene in 'CH7'. A 4-kb DNA fragment from 'CH7' containing the Hwc3 gene with the inserted LTR retrotransposon was able to induce hybrid weakness in hybrids with 'CH8' plants carrying the Hwc1 gene by genetic complementation. We investigated the differential gene expression profile of F1 plants exhibiting hybrid weakness and detected that the genes associated with energy metabolism were significantly down-regulated compared with the parents. Based on our results, we propose that LTR retrotransposons could be a potential cause of hybrid weakness in intrasubspecific hybrids in japonica rice. Understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying intrasubspecific hybrid weakness is important for increasing our knowledge on reproductive isolation and could have significant implications for rice improvement and hybrid breeding.",

Yet, the evolutionary impact of germination has mainly been studied in the context of dormancy, or for its role in reproductive isolation between species. Here, we aim to examine multiple consequences of genetic divergence on germination traits between two Arabidopsis lyrata subspecies: ssp. petraea (Eurasia) and ssp. lyrata (North America). Postdormancy germination time, a potentially adaptive trait, showed differentiation between the populations, and quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping revealed that the trait variation is mainly controlled by two antagonistic loci. These QTL areas contain several candidate genes with known function in postdormancy germination in A. thaliana. The sequence variation of three genes was consistent with differential selection, and they also included fixed nonsynonymous substitutions with potential to account for the phenotypic differentiation. We further show that the divergence between the subspecies has led to a slight but significant reduction in hybrid germination proportions, indicating incipient reproductive isolation. Comparison of reciprocal F1 and F2 progenies suggests that Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities likely act through uniparentally inherited factors. Examination of genomewide transmission ratio distortion further revealed that cytonuclear interactions cause substantial pregermination inviability in the hybrids. These results confirm that seed germination has adaptive potential beyond the dormancy stage and that hybrid seed inviability can be one of the first reproductive barriers to arise during divergence.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive isolation plays an important role in speciation as it restricts gene flow and accelerates genetic divergence between formerly interbreeding population. In rice, hybrid breakdown is a common reproductive isolation observed in both intra and inter-specific crosses. It is a type of post-zygotic reproductive isolation in which sterility and weakness are manifested in the F2 and later generations. In this study, the physiological and molecular basis of hybrid breakdown caused by two recessive genes, hbd2 and hbd3, in a cross between japonica variety, Koshihikari, and indica variety, Habataki, were investigated. Fine mapping of hbd2 resulted in the identification of the causal gene as casein kinase I (CKI1). Further analysis revealed that hbd2-CKI1 allele gains its deleterious function that causes the weakness phenotype by a change of one amino acid. As for the other gene, hbd3 was mapped to the NBS-LRR gene cluster region. It is the most common class of R-gene that triggers the immune signal in response to pathogen attack. Expression analysis of pathogen response marker genes suggested that weakness phenotype in this hybrid breakdown can be attributed to an autoimmune response. So far, this is the first evidence linking autoimmune response to post-zygotic isolation in rice. This finding provides a new insight in understanding the molecular and evolutionary mechanisms establishing post-zygotic isolation in plants.",

		"abstract": "Contact zones between recently diverged taxa provide opportunities to examine the causes of reproductive isolation and the processes that determine whether two species can coexist over a broad region. The Pacific wren (Troglodytes pacificus) and winter wren (Troglodytes hiemalis) are two morphologically similar songbirds that started diverging about 4 million years ago, older than most sister species pairs of temperate songbirds. The ranges of these species come into narrow contact in western Canada, where the two species remain distinct. To assess evidence for differentiation, hybridization and introgression in this system, we examined variation in over 250,000 single nucleotide polymorphism markers distributed across the genome. The two species formed highly divergent genetic clusters, consistent with long-term differentiation. In a set of 75 individuals, two first-generation hybrids (i.e., F1 's) were detected, indicating only moderate levels of assortative mating between these taxa. We found no recent backcrosses or other evidence of recent breeding success of F1 's, indicating very low or zero fitness of F1  hybrids. Examination of genomic variation shows evidence for only a single backcrossing event many generations ago. The moderate rate of hybridization combined with very low F1  hybrid fitness is expected to result in a population sink in the contact zone, largely explaining the narrow overlap of the two species. If such dynamics are common in nature, they could explain the narrow range overlap often observed between pairs of closely related species.",

A common incompatibility in plants is hybrid necrosis, characterized by autoimmune responses due to epistatic interactions between natural genetic variants. By systematically testing thousands of F1 hybrids of Arabidopsis thaliana strains, we identified a small number of incompatibility hot spots in the genome, often in regions densely populated by nucleotide-binding domain and leucine-rich repeat (NLR) immune receptor genes. In several cases, these immune receptor loci interact with each other, suggestive of conflict within the immune system. A particularly dangerous locus is a highly variable cluster of NLR genes, DM2, which causes multiple independent incompatibilities with genes that encode a range of biochemical functions, including NLRs. Our findings suggest that deleterious interactions of immune receptors limit the combinations of favorable disease resistance alleles accessible to plant genomes.",

		"abstract": "In plants, F1 hybrids showing hybrid weakness exhibit weaker growth than their parents. The phenotypes of hybrid weakness are often suppressed at certain temperatures. However, it is unclear whether hybrid weakness in Capsicum annuum × C. chinense is temperature-dependent or not. Our study showed that Capsicum hybrid weakness was suppressed at 30 and 35 °C and was induced at 15, 20, and 25 °C. Moreover, we investigated the time course of hybrid weakness in cell death, metabolite content, and gene expression in leaves of plants transferred to 20 °C after growing at 30 °C for 21 days. The expression of pathogen defense-related genes was upregulated at 1 day after transfer to 20 °C (DAT). Cell death was detected at 7 DAT, plant growth had almost stopped since 14 DAT, and sugars were accumulated at 42 DAT in hybrid plants. The study revealed that some sugar transporter genes, which had been upregulated since 7 DAT, were involved in sugar accumulation in Capsicum hybrid weakness. Thus, our results demonstrated that gene expression changes occur first, followed by physiological and morphological changes after induction of hybrid weakness. These responses observed in this study in Capsicum hybrid weakness are likely to be owed to plant defense responses-like reactions.",

F1 hybrid of the Oryza sativa Indian cultivars 'P.T.B.7' and 'A.D.T.14' exhibits hybrid weakness that is associated with the HWA1 and HWA2 loci. Accordingly, the aim of the present study was to analyze the hybrid weakness phenotype of the 'P.T.B.7' × 'A.D.T.14' hybrids. The height and tiller number of the F1 hybrid were lower than those of either parent, and F1 hybrid also exhibited leaf yellowing that was not observed in either parent. In addition, the present study demonstrates that SPAD values, an index correlated with chlorophyll content, are effective for evaluating the progression of hybrid weakness that is associated with the HWA1 and HWA2 loci because it accurately reflects degree of leaf yellowing. Both cell death and H2O2, a reactive oxygen species, were detected in the yellowing leaves of the F1 hybrid. Furthermore, disease resistance-related genes were upregulated in the yellowing leaves of the F1 hybrids, whereas photosynthesis-related genes tended to be downregulated. These results suggest that the hybrid weakness associated with the HWA1 and HWA2 loci involves hypersensitive response-like mechanisms.",

Many such incompatibilities are polymorphic in plants, implying an important role for genetic drift or balancing selection in their origin and evolution. Here we show that NPR1 and RPP5 loci cause a genetic incompatibility between the incipient species Capsella grandiflora and C. rubella, and the more distantly related C. rubella and C. orientalis. The incompatible RPP5 allele results from a mutation in C. rubella, while the incompatible NPR1 allele is frequent in the ancestral C. grandiflora. Compatible and incompatible NPR1 haplotypes are maintained by balancing selection in C. grandiflora, and were divergently sorted into the derived C. rubella and C. orientalis. Thus, by maintaining differentiated alleles at high frequencies, balancing selection on ancestral polymorphisms can facilitate establishing gene-flow barriers between derived populations through lineage sorting of the alternative alleles.",

		"abstract": "The transition to selfing in Capsella rubella accompanies its recent divergence from the ancestral outcrossing C. grandiflora species about 100,000 years ago. Whether the change in mating system was accompanied by the evolution of additional reproductive barriers that enforced species divergence remained unknown. Here, we show that C. rubella and C. grandiflora are reproductively separated by an endosperm-based, non-reciprocal postzygotic hybridization barrier. While hybridizations of C. rubella maternal plants with C. grandiflora pollen donors resulted in complete seed abortion caused by endosperm cellularization failure, the reciprocal hybridization resulted in the formation of small seeds with precociously cellularized endosperm. Strikingly, the transcriptomic response of both hybridizations mimicked respectively the response of paternal and maternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis thaliana, suggesting unbalanced genome strength causes hybridization failure in both species. These results provide strong support for the theory that crosses between plants of different mating systems will be unbalanced, with the outcrosser behaving like a plant of increased ploidy, evoking a response that resembles an interploidy-type seed failure. Seed incompatilibity of C. rubella pollinated by C. grandiflora followed the Bateson-Dobzhansky-Muller model, involving negative genetic interaction of multiple paternal C. grandiflora loci with at least one maternal C. rubella locus. Given that both species only recently diverged, our data suggest that a fast evolving mechanism underlies the post-zygotic hybridization barrier(s) separating both species., Changes in mating system are supposed to change levels of sexual conflict, causing reduced conflict in inbreeding compared to outbreeding species. The recently diverged species pair of the inbreeding Capsella rubella and the outbreeding C. grandiflora provides the opportunity to test this hypothesis. While hybridizations of C. rubella maternal plants with C. grandiflora pollen donors gave rise to seeds with phenotypic similarities to paternal excess hybridizations in Arabidopsis thaliana, the reciprocal hybridization had similarities to maternal excess hybridizations. These results lend support to the hypothesis that selfing reduces sexual conflict, causing the outcrossing parent to have an increased effective ploidy compared to the selfing parent, resulting in unbalanced genome ratios after hybridization and seed failure. Seed failure correlates with either precocious or delayed endosperm cellularization, in agreement with the endosperm being the battleground for sexual conflict in flowering plants. C. grandiflora and C. rubella have only recently diverged, suggesting that the genes building the hybridization barrier are rapidly evolving as a consequence of sexual conflict.",

		"abstract": "A major goal of speciation research is to reveal the genomic signatures that accompany the speciation process. Genome scans are routinely used to explore genome-wide variation and identify highly differentiated loci that may contribute to ecological divergence, but they do not incorporate spatial, phenotypic or environmental data that might enhance outlier detection. Geographic cline analysis provides a potential framework for integrating diverse forms of data in a spatially explicit framework, but has not been used to study genome-wide patterns of divergence. Aided by a first-draft genome assembly, we combined an FCT scan and geographic cline analysis to characterize patterns of genome-wide divergence between divergent pollination ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. FCT analysis of 58 872 SNPs generated via RAD-seq revealed little ecotypic differentiation (mean FCT = 0.041), although a small number of loci were moderately-to-highly diverged. Consistent with our previous results from the gene MaMyb2, which contributes to differences in flower colour, 130 loci have cline shapes that recapitulate the spatial pattern of trait divergence, suggesting that they may reside in or near the genomic regions that contribute to pollinator isolation. In the narrow hybrid zone between the ecotypes, extensive admixture among individuals and low linkage disequilibrium between markers indicate that most outlier loci are scattered throughout the genome, rather than being restricted to one or a few divergent regions. In addition to revealing the genomic consequences of ecological divergence in this system, we discuss how geographic cline analysis is a powerful but under-utilized framework for studying genome-wide patterns of divergence.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive isolation is generally regarded as the essence of the speciation process. Studying closely related species is convenient for understanding the genetic basis of reproductive isolation. Therefore, the present review is restricted to the species and subspecies of the Oryza sativa complex, which includes the two domestic rice cultivars and six wild species. Although closely related, these rice species are separated from each other by a range reproductive barriers. This review presents a comprehensive understanding of the forces that shaped the formation of reproductive barriers among and between the species of the O. sativa complex. We suggest the possibility that domestication and artificial breeding in these rice species can lead to the early stages of speciation. Understanding the evolutionary and molecular mechanisms underlying reproductive isolation in rice will increase our knowledge in speciation and would also offer practical significance for the implementation of crop improvement strategies.",

		"abstract": "Given the enormous number and high mortality of fertilized ovules in plants, it is possible that selection during the earliest stages of the life cycle plays an important role in shaping the genetic composition of plant populations. Previous research involving selection component analyses found strong evidence for viability selection in annual plant species. Yet despite this evidence, few attempts have been made to identify the magnitude and timing of viability selection as well as the mechanisms responsible for mortality among genotypes. Platypodium elegans, a Neotropical tree with high rates of early fruit mortality, represents an opportunity to study viability selection at a level of discernment not previously possible. Microsatellite markers were used to analyze the genetic composition of aborted embryos, as well as mature seeds and seedlings of the same cohort. While selection resulted in an overall decrease in self-fertilized progeny across each life stage, the greatest change in the genetic composition of progeny occurred between mature seeds and established seedlings. This suggested that inbreeding depression, and not late-acting self-incompatibility, was responsible for early selection. An investigation of the mature seed stage revealed that self-fertilized seeds weigh significantly less than outcrossed seeds. The result of this early selection conceals the mixed-mating system and high levels of inbreeding depression in Platypodium elegans, resulting in an apparently outcrossed adult population that does not differ significantly from Hardy-Weinberg expectations.",

We show that the feedback de-excitation is important for plant fitness in the field and in fluctuating light in a controlled environment but that it does not affect plant performance under constant light conditions. Our findings demonstrate that the feedback de-excitation confers a strong fitness advantage under field conditions and suggest that this advantage is due to the increase in plant tolerance to variation in light intensity rather than tolerance to high-intensity light itself.",

		"abstract": "Incompatibilities in interspeciﬁc hybrids, such as sterility and lethality, are widely observed causes of reproductive isolation and thus contribute to speciation. Because hybrid incompatibilities are caused by divergence in each of the hybridizing species, they also reveal genomic changes occurring on short evolutionary time scales that have functional consequences. These changes include divergence in protein-coding gene sequence, structure, and location, as well as divergence in noncoding DNAs. The most important unresolved issue is understanding the evolutionary causes of the divergence within species that in turn leads to incompatibility between species. Surprisingly, much of this divergence does not appear to be driven by ecological adaptation but may instead result from responses to purely mutational mechanisms or to internal genetic conﬂicts.",

Hybrid dysfunction is thought to arise most commonly through negative interactions between alleles at two or more loci. Divergence between interacting regulatory elements that affect gene expression (i.e., regulatory divergence) may be a common route for these negative interactions to arise. We review here how regulatory divergence between species can result in hybrid dysfunction, including recent theoretical support for this model. We then discuss the empirical evidence for regulatory divergence between species and evaluate evidence for misregulation as a source of hybrid dysfunction. Finally, we review unresolved questions in gene regulation as it pertains to speciation and point to areas that could benefit from future research.",

		"abstract": "In the course of generating populations of maize with teosinte chromosomal introgressions, an unusual sickly plant phenotype was noted in individuals from crosses with two teosinte accessions collected near Valle de Bravo, Mexico. The plants of these Bravo teosinte accessions appear phenotypically normal themselves and the F1 plants appear similar to typical maize × teosinte F1s. However, upon backcrossing to maize, the BC1 and subsequent generations display a number of detrimental characteristics including shorter stature, reduced seed set, and abnormal floral structures. This phenomenon is observed in all BC individuals and there is no chromosomal segment linked to the sickly plant phenotype in advanced backcross generations. Once the sickly phenotype appears in a lineage, normal plants are never again recovered by continued backcrossing to the normal maize parent. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing reveals a small number of genomic sequences, some with homology to transposable elements, that have increased in copy number in the backcross populations. Transcriptome analysis of seedlings, which do not have striking phenotypic abnormalities, identified segments of 18 maize genes that exhibit increased expression in sickly plants. A de novo assembly of transcripts present in plants exhibiting the sickly phenotype identified a set of 59 upregulated novel transcripts. These transcripts include some examples with sequence similarity to transposable elements and other sequences present in the recurrent maize parent (W22) genome as well as novel sequences not present in the W22 genome. Genome-wide profiles of gene expression, DNA methylation, and small RNAs are similar between sickly plants and normal controls, although a few upregulated transcripts and transposable elements are associated with altered small RNA or methylation profiles. This study documents hybrid incompatibility and genome instability triggered by the backcrossing of Bravo teosinte with maize. We name this phenomenon \"hybrid decay\" and present ideas on the mechanism that may underlie it.",

Here we report a method for performing GWAS that does not require genotyping of large numbers of individuals. Instead XP-GWAS (extreme-phenotype GWAS) relies on genotyping pools of individuals from a diversity panel that have extreme phenotypes. This analysis measures allele frequencies in the extreme pools, enabling discovery of associations between genetic variants and traits of interest. This method was evaluated in maize (Zea mays) using the well-characterized kernel row number trait, which was selected to enable comparisons between the results of XP-GWAS and conventional GWAS. An exome-sequencing strategy was used to focus sequencing resources on genes and their flanking regions. A total of 0.94 million variants were identified and served as evaluation markers; comparisons among pools showed that 145 of these variants were statistically associated with the kernel row number phenotype. These trait-associated variants were significantly enriched in regions identified by conventional GWAS. XP-GWAS was able to resolve several linked QTL and detect trait-associated variants within a single gene under a QTL peak. XP-GWAS is expected to be particularly valuable for detecting genes or alleles responsible for quantitative variation in species for which extensive genotyping resources are not available, such as wild progenitors of crops, orphan crops, and other poorly characterized species such as those of ecological interest.",

The QTLseqr package is quick and produces publication quality figures and tables. Next-Generation Sequencing Bulk Segregant Analysis (NGS-BSA) is efficient in detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL). Despite the popularity of NGS-BSA and the R statistical platform, no R packages are currently available for NGS-BSA. We present QTLseqr, an R package for NGS-BSA that identifies QTL using two statistical approaches: QTL-seq and G’. These approaches use a simulation method and a tricube smoothed G statistic, respectively, to identify and assess statistical significance of QTL. QTLseqr can import and filter SNP data, calculate SNP distributions, relative allele frequencies, G’ values, and log10 (p-values), enabling identification and plotting of QTL.

		"abstract": "The genetic architecture of speciation, i.e., how intrinsic genomic incompatibilities promote reproductive isolation (RI) between diverging lineages, is one of the best-kept secrets of evolution. To directly assess whether incompatibilities arise in a limited set of large-effect speciation genes, or in a multitude of loci, we examined the geographic and genomic landscapes of introgression across the hybrid zones of 41 pairs of frog and toad lineages in the Western Palearctic region. As the divergence between lineages increases, phylogeographic transitions progressively become narrower, and larger parts of the genome resist introgression. This suggests that anuran speciation proceeds through a gradual accumulation of multiple barrier loci scattered across the genome, which ultimately deplete hybrid fitness by intrinsic postzygotic isolation, with behavioral isolation being achieved only at later stages. Moreover, these loci were disproportionately sex linked in one group (Hyla) but not in others (Rana and Bufotes), implying that large X-effects are not necessarily a rule of speciation with undifferentiated sex chromosomes. The highly polygenic nature of RI and the lack of hemizygous X/Z chromosomes could explain why the speciation clock ticks slower in amphibians compared to other vertebrates. The clock-like dynamics of speciation combined with the analytical focus on hybrid zones offer perspectives for more standardized practices of species delimitation.",

		"abstract": "Aim Seasonal migration is a common phenomenon in animals and connects geographically distant ecosystems. Considerable variation has been documented in this behaviour and migratory divides (contact zones between populations that use different routes to navigate around ecological barriers) are an example of this. Migratory divides could have important implications for ecological speciation as hybrids in divides take intermediate routes and it has been predicted that these routes will be ecologically inferior as they bring hybrids over barriers that parental forms avoid. We provide the first test of this prediction here using a well-characterized divide between coastal and inland subspecies of Swainson’s thrushes. Location North, Central and South America. Time period 2006–2013. Major taxa studied Birds. Methods We used ecological niche models and analyses of landscape connectivity to predict suitable habitat for coastal and inland thrushes on migration and identify optimal migratory routes. We compared estimates of habitat suitability and landscape connectivity along the actual migratory routes of birds tracked with light-level geolocators. Results Consistent with predictions for migratory divides, niche models estimated lower habitat suitability in the intermediate range between the migratory ranges of parental forms. Furthermore, our models of landscape connectivity predicted optimal routes that circumvent this intermediate area. Birds taking intermediate routes used stopover sites of lower predicted habitat suitability than birds migrating on either side of the divide and overlapped less with optimal paths. Main conclusions Our results support the prediction that intermediate routes of hybrids in migratory divides are ecologically inferior to those of parental forms. This finding suggests ecological differences are helping to maintain divides and could have broad implications, with divides shaping the distribution and maintenance of species boundaries globally and across many taxonomic groups.",

Characterizing the traits that cause defects in hybrids illuminates how and when gene flow is expected to occur. Inviability and sterility are extreme examples of fitness reductions but are not the only type of defects in hybrids. Some traits specific to hybrids are more subtle but are important to determine their fitness. In this report, we study whether F1 hybrids between two species pairs of Drosophila are as attractive as the parental species. We find that in both species pairs, the sexual attractiveness of the F1 hybrids is reduced and that pure species discriminate strongly against them. We also find that the cuticular hydrocarbon (CHC) profile of the female hybrids is intermediate between the parental species. Perfuming experiments show that modifying the CHC profile of the female hybrids to resemble pure species improves their chances of mating. Our results show that behavioral discrimination against hybrids might be an important component of the persistence of species that can hybridize.",

The observation of hybridisation between two of these species challenges this species delimitation. The mechanisms of reproductive isolation essential to the maintenance of species integrity remain unclear. Here, we conducted upscaled hybridisation experiments to obtain large numbers of hybrid and non-hybrid dormant propagules. Through hatching assays, we compared the zygote viability of hybrid with non-hybrid dormant propagules. Furthermore, we investigated populations of F1 hybrid clones and assessed their clonal growth rate and the ability to reproduce sexually. Our results demonstrated higher rates of morphological abnormality and associated mortality in dormant propagules of hybrids compared to non-hybrids yet hatching rates of healthy-looking propagules proved similar. F1 hybrids exhibited high clonal population growth rates, nevertheless, we also observed strong differences between clones and a strong influence of parental genotype identity. Two-thirds of the F1 hybrid clones showed a low incidence of sexual reproduction and almost never produced dormant propagules. Clones with high population growth rates seemed to invest less in sexual reproduction. Our results clearly demonstrate the existence of intrinsic postzygotic barriers caused by relatively high mortality of dormant propagules. Furthermore, the low ability of most hybrid clones to engage in sexual reproduction may reduce the long-term fitness of hybrid clones. These postzygotic barriers probably impede genetic exchange between parental species and contribute to the maintenance of their integrity.",

		"abstract": "Postzygote isolation is an important part of species isolation, especially for fish, and it can be divided into two aspects: genetic isolation and ecological isolation. With the increase in parental genetic distance, the intensity of genetic isolation between them also increases. Will the increase in parental ecological niche differences also lead to the increase in ecological isolation intensity between them? This question is difficult to answer based on the current literature due to the lack of hybridization cases of contrasting ecological niche parents. Cyprinid fish parents (Schizothorax wangchiachii and Percocypris pingi) with contrasting ecological niches (herbivorous and carnivorous) and their F1 hybrids were used as research objects. Fish and periphytic algae were selected as food corresponding to different parental resources. The foraging-related traits of these hybrids are generally the same between parents; however, the intermediate foraging traits of hybrids did not result in intermediate foraging performance for parental resources, and these hybrids could hardly forage for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources was caused not only by the decline in the foraging ability of these hybrids but, more importantly, by the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids initially showed a high interest in foraging small fishes; however, after the first successful capture, these hybrids had difficulty ingesting fish and spit them out, which led to the subsequent decrease in foraging activity. We designed a series of experiments to explore the mechanism of the fish spitting of these hybrids, excluding the taste and the size of prey, and found that the decrease in their pharyngeal tooth puncture ability may be the reason. This study was the first to demonstrate that these parents with contrasting ecological niches will produce great postzygotic ecological isolation for parental resources. The poor foraging performance of these hybrids for parental resources is mainly due to the decrease in foraging activity. Interestingly, these hybrids have obvious fish-spitting behaviour, which is a typical example of the incompatibility between intermediate traits and genetic behaviors.",

		"abstract": "Although studies increasingly disentangle phenotypic plasticity from evolutionary responses to environmental change, few test for transgenerational plasticity in this context. Here, we evaluate whether phenotypic divergence of acorn ants in response to urbanization is driven by transgenerational plasticity rather than evolution. F2 generation worker ants (offspring of laboratory‐born queens) exhibited similar divergence among urban and rural populations as field‐born worker ants, suggesting that evolutionary divergence rather than transgenerational plasticity was primarily responsible for shifts toward higher heat tolerance and diminished cold tolerance in urban acorn ants. Hybrid offspring from matings between urban and rural populations also indicated that evolutionary divergence was likely the primary mechanism underlying population differences in thermal tolerance. Specifically, thermal tolerance traits were not inherited either maternally or paternally in the hybrid pairings as would be expected for strong parental or grandparental effects mediated through a single sex. Urban–rural hybrid offspring provided further insight into the genetic architecture of thermal adaptation. Heat tolerance of hybrids more resembled the urban–urban pure type, whereas cold tolerance of hybrids more resembled the rural–rural pure type. As a consequence, thermal tolerance traits in this system appear to be influenced by dominance rather than being purely additive traits, and heat and cold tolerance might be determined by separate genes. Though transgenerational plasticity does not appear to explain divergence of acorn ant thermal tolerance, its role in divergence of other traits and across other urbanization gradients merits further study.",

		"abstract": "Genomic scans of multiple populations often reveal marker loci with greatly increased differentiation between populations. Often this differentiation coincides in space with contrasts in ecological factors, forming a genetic–environment association (GEA). GEAs imply a role for local adaptation, and so it is tempting to conclude that the strongly differentiated markers are themselves under ecologically based divergent selection, or are closely linked to loci under such selection. Here, we highlight an alternative and neglected explanation: intrinsic (i.e. environment-independent) pre- or post-zygotic genetic incompatibilities rather than local adaptation can be responsible for increased differentiation. Intrinsic genetic incompatibilities create endogenous barriers to gene flow, also known as tension zones, whose location can shift over time. However, tension zones have a tendency to become trapped by, and therefore to coincide with, exogenous barriers due to ecological selection. This coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can occur easily in spatially subdivided populations, even if the loci involved are unlinked. The result is that local adaptation explains where genetic breaks are positioned, but not necessarily their existence, which can be best explained by endogenous incompatibilities. More precisely, we show that (i) the coupling of endogenous and exogenous barriers can easily occur even when ecological selection is weak; (ii) when environmental heterogeneity is fine-grained, GEAs can emerge at incompatibility loci, but only locally, in places where habitats and gene pools are sufficiently intermingled to maintain linkage disequilibria between genetic incompatibilities, local-adaptation genes and neutral loci. Furthermore, the association between the locally adapted and intrinsically incompatible alleles (i.e. the sign of linkage disequilibrium between endogenous and exogenous loci) is arbitrary and can form in either direction. Reviewing results from the literature, we find that many predictions of our model are supported, including endogenous genetic barriers that coincide with environmental boundaries, local GEA in mosaic hybrid zones, and inverted or modified GEAs at distant locations. We argue that endogenous genetic barriers are often more likely than local adaptation to explain the majority of Fst-outlying loci observed in genome scan approaches – even when these are correlated to environmental variables.",

We also analyze the correlation among taxonomically diagnostic leaf traits to understand the challenges hybrids pose to classification models based on leaf spectra. Classification models based on leaf spectra identified two species of Dryas with 99.7% overall accuracy and genetic populations with 98.9% overall accuracy. All regions of the spectrum carried significant phylogenetic signal. Hybrids were classified with an average overall accuracy of 80%, and our morphological analysis revealed weak trait correlations within hybrids compared to parent species. Reflectance spectra captured genetic variation and accurately distinguished fine-scale population structure and hybrids of morphologically similar, closely related species growing in their home environment. Our findings suggest that fine-scale evolutionary diversity is captured by reflectance spectra and should be considered as spectrally-based biodiversity assessments become more prevalent.",

		"abstract": "Animal breeding faces one of the most significant changes of the past decades - the implementation of genomic selection. Genomic selection uses dense marker maps to predict the breeding value of animals with reported accuracies that are up to 0.31 higher than those of pedigree indexes, without the need to phenotype the animals themselves, or close relatives thereof. The basic principle is that because of the high marker density, each quantitative trait loci (QTL) is in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with at least one nearby marker. The process involves putting a reference population together of animals with known phenotypes and genotypes to estimate the marker effects. Marker effects have been estimated with several different methods that generally aim at reducing the dimensions of the marker data. Nearly all reported models only included additive effects. Once the marker effects are estimated, breeding values of young selection candidates can be predicted with reported accuracies up to 0.85. Although results from simulation studies suggest that different models may yield more accurate genomic estimated breeding values (GEBVs) for different traits, depending on the underlying QTL distribution of the trait, there is so far only little evidence from studies based on real data to support this. The accuracy of genomic predictions strongly depends on characteristics of the reference populations, such as number of animals, number of markers, and the heritability of the recorded phenotype. Another important factor is the relationship between animals in the reference population and the evaluated animals. The breakup of LD between markers and QTL across generations advocates frequent re-estimation of marker effects to maintain the accuracy of GEBVs at an acceptable level. Therefore, at low frequencies of re-estimating marker effects, it becomes more important that the model that estimates the marker effects capitalizes on LD information that is persistent across generations.",

		"abstract": "When related taxa hybridize extensively, their genomes may become increasingly homogenized over time. This mixing via hybridization creates conservation challenges when it reduces genetic or phenotypic diversity and when it endangers previously distinct species via genetic swamping [1]. However, hybridization also facilitates admixture mapping of traits that distinguish each species and the associated genes that maintain distinctiveness despite ongoing gene flow [2]. We address these dual aspects of hybridization in the golden-winged/blue-winged warbler complex, two phenotypically divergent warblers that are indistinguishable using traditional molecular markers and that draw substantial conservation attention [3, 4, 5]. Whole-genome comparisons show that differentiation is extremely low: only six small genomic regions exhibit strong differences. Four of these divergence peaks occur in proximity to genes known to be involved in feather development or pigmentation: agouti signaling protein (ASIP), follistatin (FST), ecodysplasin (EDA), wingless-related integration site (Wnt), and beta-carotene oxygenase 2 (BCO2). Throat coloration—the most striking plumage difference between these warblers—is perfectly associated with the promoter region of agouti, and genotypes at this locus obey simple Mendelian recessive inheritance of the black-throated phenotype characteristic of golden-winged warblers. The more general pattern of genomic similarity between these warblers likely results from a protracted period of hybridization, contradicting the broadly accepted hypothesis that admixture results from solely anthropogenic habitat change in the past two centuries [4]. Considered in concert, these results are relevant to both the genetic architecture of avian feather pigmentation and the evolutionary history and conservation challenges associated with these declining songbirds.",

		"abstract": "Animal migration demands an interconnected suite of adaptations for individuals to navigate over long distances. This trait complex is crucial for small birds whose migratory behaviors—such as directionality—are more likely innate, rather than being learned as in many longer-lived birds. Identifying causal genes has been a central goal of migration ecology, and this endeavor has been furthered by genome-scale comparisons. However, even the most successful studies of migration genetics have achieved low-resolution associations, identifying large chromosomal regions that encompass hundreds of genes, one or more of which might be causal. Here we leverage the genomic similarity among golden-winged (\n              Vermivora chrysoptera\n              ) and blue-winged (\n              V. cyanoptera\n              ) warblers to identify a single gene—\n              vacuolar protein sorting 13A\n              (\n              VPS13A\n              )—that is associated with distinct differences in migration to Central American (CA) or South American (SA) wintering areas. We find reduced sequence variation in this gene region for SA wintering birds, and show this is the likely result of natural selection on this locus. In humans, variants of\n              VPS13A\n              are linked to the neurodegenerative disorder chorea-acanthocytosis. This association provides one of the strongest gene-level associations with avian migration differences.",

This indicates that it has spread under strong positive selection, although the exact nature of the selection is unknown. The finding that an important brain gene has continued to evolve adaptively in anatomically modern humans suggests the ongoing evolutionary plasticity of the human brain.

		"abstract": "Darwin’s Origin of Species is often criticized for having little to say about speciation. The complaint focuses in particular on Darwin’s supposed failure to explain the evolution of the sterility and inviability of interspecific hybrids. But in his chapter on hybridism, Darwin, working without genetics, got as close to the modern understanding of the evolution of hybrid sterility and inviability as might reasonably be expected. In particular, after surveying what was then known about interspecific crosses and the resulting hybrids, he established two facts that, while now taken for granted, were at the time radical. First, the sterility barriers between species are neither specially endowed by a creator nor directly favored by natural selection but rather evolve as incidental by‐products of interspecific divergence. Second, the sterility of species hybrids results when their development is “disturbed by two organizations having been compounded into one.” Bateson, Dobzhansky, and Muller later put Mendelian detail to Darwin’s inference that the species‐specific factors controlling development (i.e., genes) are sometimes incompatible. In this article, I highlight the major developments in our understanding of these interspecific genetic incompatibilities—from Darwin to Muller to modern theory—and review comparative, genetic, and molecular rules that characterize the evolution of hybrid sterility and inviability.",

We present a model of two-locus incompatibilities that distinguishes among three types of hybrid interactions: those between heterozygous loci (H0), those between a heterozygous and a homozygous (or hemizygous) locus (H1), and those between homozygous loci (H2). We predict the relative fitnesses of hybrid genotypes by calculating the expected numbers of each type of incompatibility. We use this model to study Haldane's rule and the large effect of X chromosomes on postzygotic isolation. We show that the severity of H0 vs. H1 incompatibilities is key to understanding Haldane's rule, while the severity of H1 vs. H2 incompatibilities must also be considered to explain large X effects. Large X effects are not inevitable in backcross analyses but rather—like Haldane's rule—may often reflect the recessivity of alleles causing postzygotic isolation. We also consider incompatibilities involving the Y (or W) chromosome and maternal effects. Such incompatibilities are common in Drosophila species crosses, and their consequences in male- vs. female-heterogametic taxa may explain the pattern of exceptions to Haldane's rule.",

Most analyses of the loci involved in such hybrid incompatibilities have suffered from low genetic resolution. Here I present a ﬁneresolution genetic screen that allows systematic counting, mapping, and characterizing of a large number of hybrid incompatibility loci in a model genetic system. Using small autosomal deletions from D. melanogaster and a hybrid rescue mutation from D. simulans, I measured the viability of hybrid males that are simultaneously hemizygous for a small region of the D. simulans autosomal genome and hemizygous for the D. melanogaster X chromosome. These hybrid males are exposed to the full effects of any recessiverecessive epistatic incompatibilities present in these regions. A screen of ف70% of the D. simulans autosomal genome reveals 20 hybrid-lethal and 20 hybrid-semilethal regions that are incompatible with the D. melanogaster X. In further crosses, I conﬁrm the epistatic nature of hybrid lethality by showing that all of the incompatibilities are rescued when the D. melanogaster X is replaced with a D. simulans X. Combined with information from previous studies, these results show that the number of recessive incompatibilities is approximately eightfold larger than the number of dominant ones. Finally, I estimate that a total of ف191 hybrid-lethal incompatibilities separate D. melanogaster and D. simulans, indicating extensive functional divergence between these species’ genomes.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive isolation between related oak species within one taxonomic section is incomplete. Even though pre- and post­zygotic isolation mechanisms have been described for interfer­tile oak species, natural hybridization is common in contact zones between related oaks. The apparent restriction of inter­specific hybrids between ecologically divergent species to intermediate environments in contact zones suggests postzy­gotic isolation via environmental selection against hybrids in parental environments. Overrepresentation of hybrids in seeds as compared to adult trees provides additional indirect evi­dence for selection against hybrids. Here, we used genetic assignment analyses in progeny obtained from a sympatric stand of Quercus rubra and Quercus ellipsoidalis, two interfertile species with different adaptations to drought, to characterize the number of hybrids and “pure” species in the non-germinated acorns and in seedlings. The occurrence of 43.6 % F1 hybrids and introgressive forms among the non-germinated acorns and their very low frequency in the seedlings (9.3 %) is to our knowledge the first direct evidence for early selection against hybrids in oaks possibly as result of genetic incompatibilities. Additionally, we found a signature of positive selection on EST-SSR PIE200 in Q. rubra which needs further confirmation. These results contribute to our under­standing of reproductive isolation and divergence between interfertile",

		"abstract": "Oak species show a wide variation in morphological and physiological characters, and species boundaries between closely related species are often not clear-cut. Still, despite frequent interspecific gene flow, oaks maintain distinct morphological and physiological adaptations. In sympatric stands, spatial distribution of species with different ecological requirements is not random but constrained by soil and other microenvironmental factors. Pre-zygotic isolation (e.g. cross incompatibilities, asynchrony in flowering, pollen competition) and post-zygotic isolation (divergent selection) contribute to the maintenance of species integrity in sympatric oak stands. The antagonistic effects of interspecific gene flow and divergent selection are reflected in the low genetic differentiation between hybridizing oak species at most genomic regions interspersed by regions with signatures of divergent selection (outlier regions). In the near future, the availability of high-density genetic linkage maps anchored to scaffolds of a sequenced Q. robur genome will allow to characterize the underlying genes in these outlier regions and their putative role in reproductive isolation between species. Reciprocal transplant experiments of seedlings between parental environments can be used to characterize selection on outlier genes. High transferability of gene-based markers will enable comparative outlier screens in different oak species.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization and introgression are pervasive evolutionary phenomena that provide insight into the selective forces that maintain species boundaries, permit gene flow, and control the direction of evolutionary change. Poplar trees (Populus L.) are well known for their ability to form viable hybrids and maintain their distinct species boundaries despite this interspecific gene flow. We sought to quantify the hybridization dynamics and postzygotic fitness within a hybrid stand of balsam poplar (Populus balsamifera L.), eastern cottonwood (P. deltoides Marsh.), and their natural hybrids to gain insight into the barriers maintaining this stable hybrid zone. We observed asymmetrical hybrid formation with P. deltoides acting as the seed parent, but with subsequent introgression biased toward P. balsamifera. Native hybrids expressed fitness traits intermediate to the parental species and were not universally unfit. That said, native hybrid seedlings were absent from the seedling population, which may indicate additional selective pressures controlling their recruitment. It is imperative that we understand the selective forces maintaining this native hybrid zone in order to quantify the impact of exotic poplar hybrids on this native system.",

Nonnormal data such as counts or proportions often defy classical statistical procedures. Generalized linear mixed models (GLMMs) provide a more flexible approach for analyzing nonnormal data when random effects are present. The explosion of research on GLMMs in the last decade has generated considerable uncertainty for practitioners in ecology and evolution. Despite the availability of accurate techniques for estimating GLMM parameters in simple cases, complex GLMMs are challenging to fit and statistical inference such as hypothesis testing remains difficult. We review the use (and misuse) of GLMMs in ecology and evolution, discuss estimation and inference and summarize ‘best-practice’ data analysis procedures for scientists facing this challenge.",

		"abstract": "Genetic incompatibilities can emerge as a byproduct of genetic divergence. According to Dobzhansky and Muller, an allele that ﬁxes in one population may be incompatible with an allele at a different locus in another population when the two alleles are brought together in hybrids. Orr showed that the number of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) should accumulate faster than linearly—i.e., snowball—as two lineages diverge. Several studies have attempted to test the snowball effect using data from natural populations. One limitation of these studies is that they have focused on predictions of the Orr model, but not on its underlying assumptions. Here, we use a computational model of RNA folding to test both predictions and assumptions of the Orr model. Two populations are allowed to evolve in allopatry on a holey ﬁtness landscape. We ﬁnd that the number of inviable introgressions (an indicator for the number of DMIs) snowballs, but does so more slowly than expected. We show that this pattern is explained, in part, by the fact that DMIs can disappear after they have arisen, contrary to the assumptions of the Orr model. This occurs because DMIs become progressively more complex (i.e., involve alleles at more loci) as a result of later substitutions. We also ﬁnd that most DMIs involve .2 loci, i.e., they are complex. Reproductive isolation does not snowball because DMIs do not act independently of each other. We conclude that the RNA model supports the central prediction of the Orr model that the number of DMIs snowballs, but challenges other predictions, as well as some of its underlying assumptions.",

SCA are based on population genetic models and yield selection estimates directly in terms of predicted allele frequency change. This paper explores the statistical properties of gSCA: experiments that apply SCA to genome-wide scoring of SNPs in field sampled individuals. Computer simulations indicate that gSCA involving a few thousand genotyped samples can detect allele frequency changes of the magnitude that has been documented in field experiments on diverse taxa. To detect selection, imprecise genotyping from low-level sequencing of large samples of individuals provides much greater power than precise genotyping of smaller samples. The simulations also demonstrate the efficacy of ‘haplotype matching’, a method to combine information from a limited collection of whole genome sequence (the reference panel) with the much larger sample of field individuals that are measured for fitness. Pooled sequencing is demonstrated as another way to increase statistical power. Finally, I discuss the interpretation of selection estimates in relation to the Beavis effect, the overestimation of selection intensities at significant loci.",

To improve understanding of the genetic architectures and molecular mechanisms that underlie these interactions, we comprehensively dissected the genetic bases of 17 independent instances of the same cryptic colony phenotype in a yeast cross. In eight cases, the phenotype resulted from a genetic interaction between a de novo mutation and one or more cryptic variants. The number and identities of detected cryptic variants depended on the mutated gene. In the nine remaining cases, the phenotype arose without a de novo mutation due to two different classes of higher-order genetic interactions that only involve cryptic variants. Our results may be relevant to other species and disease, as most of the mutations and cryptic variants identified in our study reside in components of a partially conserved and oncogenic signalling pathway., \nCryptic genetic variants may not individually show discernible phenotypic effects, but collectively, these polymorphisms can lead to unexpected, genetically complex traits that might be relevant to evolution and disease.

To test this, we evaluated the reproductive success of introduced brook trout (BT: Salvelinus fontinalis), native white-spotted charr (WSC: S. leucomaenis) and their hybrids in a natural stream in Hokkaido, Japan, where the two parental species show remarkably different male secondary sexual characteristics, such as elongated jaws and deeper bodies. We predicted that introgression from WSC is maladaptive for BT males because the BT male has more prominent secondary sexual characteristics. Our results suggest that both sexual selection and outbreeding depression in males and females significantly influence an individual's reproductive success. Our results also suggest that asymmetric introgression may increase the risks to persistence in the recipient species.",

		"abstract": "Divergence in phenotypic traits often contributes to premating isolation between lineages, but could also promote isolation at postmating stages. Phenotypic differences could directly result in mechanical isolation or hybrids with maladapted traits; alternatively, when alleles controlling these trait differences pleiotropically affect other components of development, differentiation could indirectly produce genetic incompatibilities in hybrids. Here, we determined the strength of nine postmating and intrinsic postzygotic reproductive barriers among 10 species of Jaltomata (Solanaceae), including species with highly divergent floral traits. To evaluate the relative importance of floral trait diversification for the strength of these postmating barriers, we assessed their relationship to floral divergence, genetic distance, geographical context, and ecological differences, using conventional tests and a new linear-mixed modeling approach. Despite close evolutionary relationships, all species pairs showed moderate to strong isolation. Nonetheless, floral trait divergence was not a consistent predictor of the strength of isolation; instead this was best explained by genetic distance, although we found evidence for mechanical isolation in one species, and a positive relationship between floral trait divergence and fruit set isolation across species pairs. Overall, our data indicate that intrinsic postzygotic isolation is more strongly associated with genome-wide genetic differentiation, rather than floral divergence.",

		"abstract": "1. Closely related taxa may be maintained as distinct species by a variety of reproductive isolating mechanisms. These include: inability to produce hybrid offspring, endogenous selection against hybrids in the form of genomic incompatibilities, and exogenous selection observable in genotype-by-environment interactions. To understand the relative importance of these three isolating mechanisms, we performed hand-pollination and reciprocal transplant experiments in a natural plant hybrid zone. 2. We measured reproductive isolation by making crosses between two parent species of Penstemon and naturally occurring hybrids. Inclusion of reciprocal hybrid crosses allowed us to determine whether fitness components differed depending on the identity of the mother. 3. Hybrid performance was evaluated in the greenhouse and in a reciprocal transplant experiment in the field. We measured fruit set, seed set, seed weight, time required for fruits to mature and seedling growth for potted plants. To test for exogenous isolation, we planted pure parents, reciprocal F₁ hybrids and later generation hybrids in a reciprocal transplant experiment, and measured survival. 4. On average, interspecific crosses produced as many seeds as conspecific crosses. Hybrid performance was also equal to or greater than parents in all environments, including the greenhouse and all field gardens, indicating a lack of endogenous isolation. Parent species and reciprocal F₁ hybrids differed in many traits measured. In each field garden, the hybrid with the native cytoplasm had a higher survival rate, suggesting local adaptation to different elevations. 5. Synthesis. Exogenous factors that differ along elevational gradients can be more important than intrinsic genetic incompatibilities in determining the fitness of plant hybrids. Our results illustrate the importance of studying hybrid performance in multiple environments and in generating reciprocal hybrids to test for isolating mechanisms in natural hybrid zones.",

However, how this mechanism evolved has remained unanswered. A dynamic model shows that the conﬂict between paternally and maternally inherited genomes may drive them to an evolutionary “arms race” of their GE and GS productions, respectively. This results in paternally expressed GE and maternally expressed GS, and their evolutionarily stable intensities are both decreasing functions of species-speciﬁc degree of paternity and GE and GS production costs, thereby establishing a mechanism for postzygotic isolation.",

The recent shift of Rhagoletis pomonella from its native host downy hawthorn (Crataegus mollis) to introduced apple (Malus domestica) in the northeastern United States is a classic example of sympatric host race formation. Here, we test whether R. pomonella has similarly formed host races on four native Crataegus species in the southern United States: western mayhaw (C. opaca), blueberry hawthorn (C. brachyacantha), southern red hawthorn (C. mollis var. texana) and green hawthorn (C. viridis). These four southern hosts differ from each other in their fruiting phenology and in the volatile compounds emitted from the surface of their fruits. These two traits form the basis of ecological reproductive isolation between downy hawthorn and apple flies in the north. We report evidence from microsatellite population surveys and eclosion studies supporting the existence of genetically differentiated and partially reproductively isolated host races of southern hawthorn flies. The results provide an example of host shifting and ecological divergence involving native plants and imply that speciation with gene flow may be commonly initiated in Rhagoletis when ecological opportunity presents itself.",

		"abstract": "The molecular mechanisms underlying major phenotypic changes that have evolved repeatedly in nature are generally unknown. Pelvic loss in different natural populations of threespine stickleback fish has occurred by regulatory mutations deleting a tissue-specific enhancer of the Pituitary homeobox transcription factor 1 (Pitx1) gene. The high prevalence of deletion mutations at Pitx1 may be influenced by inherent structural features of the locus. Although Pitx1 null mutations are lethal in laboratory animals, Pitx1 regulatory mutations show molecular signatures of positive selection in pelvic-reduced populations. These studies illustrate how major expression and morphological changes can arise by single mutational leaps in natural populations, producing new adaptive alleles via recurrent regulatory alterations in a key developmental control gene.",

These discoveries have been enabled by the rapid growth of methods designed to detect and characterize introgression from whole-genome sequencing data. A large class of phylogenomic methods makes use of data across species to infer and characterize introgression based on expectations from the multispecies coalescent. These methods range from simple tests, such as the D-statistic, to model-based approaches for inferring phylogenetic networks. Here, we provide a detailed overview of the various signals that different modes of introgression are expected leave in the genome, and how current methods are designed to detect them. We discuss the strengths and pitfalls of these approaches and identify areas for future development, highlighting the different signals of introgression, and the power of each method to detect them. We conclude with a discussion of current challenges in inferring introgression and how they could potentially be addressed.",

		"abstract": "The use of hybrids is widespread in agriculture, yet the molecular basis for hybrid vigor (heterosis) remains obscure. To identify molecular components that may contribute to trait heterosis, we analyzed paired proteomic and transcriptomic data from seedling leaf and mature leaf blade tissues of maize hybrids and their inbred parents. Nuclear- and plastid-encoded subunits of complexes required for protein synthesis in the chloroplast and for the light reactions of photosynthesis were expressed above midparent and high-parent levels, respectively. Consistent with previous reports in Arabidopsis, ethylene biosynthetic enzymes were expressed below midparent levels in the hybrids, suggesting a conserved mechanism for heterosis between monocots and dicots. The ethylene biosynthesis mutant, acs2/acs6, largely phenocopied the hybrid proteome, indicating that a reduction in ethylene biosynthesis may mediate the differences between inbreds and their hybrids. To rank the relevance of expression differences to trait heterosis, we compared seedling leaf protein levels to the adult plant height of 15 hybrids. Hybrid/midparent expression ratios were most positively correlated with hybrid/midparent plant height ratios for the chloroplast ribosomal proteins. Our results show that increased expression of chloroplast ribosomal proteins in hybrid seedling leaves is mediated by reduced expression of ethylene biosynthetic enzymes and that the degree of their overexpression in seedlings can quantitatively predict adult trait heterosis.",

		"abstract": "Fisher's fundamental theorem states that natural selection improves mean fitness. Fitness, in turn, is often equated with population growth. This leads to an absurd prediction that life evolves to ever-faster growth rates, yet no one seriously claims generally slower population growth rates in the Triassic compared with the present day. I review here, using non-technical language, how fitness can improve yet stay constant (stagnation paradox), and why an unambiguous measure of population fitness does not exist. Subfields use different terminology for aspects of the paradox, referring to stasis, cryptic evolution or the difficulty of choosing an appropriate fitness measure; known resolutions likewise use diverse terms from environmental feedback to density dependence and ‘evolutionary environmental deterioration’. The paradox vanishes when these concepts are understood, and adaptation can lead to declining reproductive output of a population when individuals can improve their fitness by exploiting conspecifics. This is particularly readily observable when males participate in a zero-sum game over paternity and population output depends more strongly on female than male fitness. Even so, the jury is still out regarding the effect of sexual conflict on population fitness. Finally, life-history theory and genetic studies of microevolutionary change could pay more attention to each other.",

In angiosperms, seed development requires the intimate coordination of three distinct entities — maternal tissue and two offspring, embryo and embryo-nourishing endosperm. Although seeds are cornerstones of many terrestrial ecosystems and human diets, we are only beginning to understand the interactions among seed tissues and the molecular processes and genes that determine them. Recent studies of gene expression and function in distantly related angiosperms, combined with over 100 years of embryological research, have repeatedly highlighted the endosperm associated with maternal-filial boundaries as a central point in seed developmental dynamics. In this review, we highlight evidence that links this zone with nutritional dynamics, developmental signaling, and imprinted gene expression. We suggest that the underappreciated diversity of this specialized endosperm across angiosperms deserves further study from developmental, molecular, and genetic perspectives.",

		"abstract": "Premise of the study: Phylogenomic datasets using genomes and transcriptomes provide rich opportunities beyond resolving bifurcating phylogenetic relationships. Monkeyflower (Phrymaceae) is a model system for evolutionary ecology. However, it lacks a well-supported phylogeny for a stable taxonomy and for macroevolutionary comparisons.\nMethods: We sampled 24 genomes and transcriptomes in Phrymaceae and closely related families, including eight newly sequenced transcriptomes. We reconstructed the phylogeny using IQ-TREE and ASTRAL, evaluated gene tree discordance using PhyParts, Quartet Sampling, and cloudogram, and carried out phylogenetic network analyses using PhyloNet and HyDe. We searched for whole genome duplication (WGD) events using chromosome numbers, synonymous distance, and gene duplication events. \nKey results: Most gene trees support the monophyly of Phrymaceae and each of its tribes. Most gene trees also support the tribe Mimuleae being sister to Phrymeae + Diplaceae + Leucocarpeae, with extensive gene tree discordance among the latter three. Despite the discordance, polyphyly of Mimulus s.l. is strongly supported, and no particular reticulation event among the Phrymaceae tribes is well supported. Reticulation likely occurred among Erythranthe bicolor and close relatives. No ancient WGD event was detected in Phrymaceae. Instead, small-scale duplications are among potential drivers of macroevolutionary diversification of Phrymaceae.\nConclusions: We show that analysis of reticulate evolution is sensitive to taxon sampling and methods used. We also demonstrate that genome-scale data do not always fully \"resolve\" phylogenetic relationships. They present rich opportunities to investigate reticulate evolution, and gene and genome evolution involved in lineage diversification and adaptation.",

Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that are ‘intrinsic’, meaning they affect viability and sterility in the laboratory. Theory predicts that ecological selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities, but tests of this hypothesis are scarce. In this article, we compiled genetic data for F\n            2\n            hybrid crosses between divergent populations of threespine stickleback fish (\n            Gasterosteus aculeatus\n            L.) that were born and raised in either the field (semi-natural experimental ponds) or the laboratory (aquaria). We tested for differences in excess heterozygosity between these two environments at ancestry informative loci—a genetic signature of selection against incompatibilities. We found that excess ancestry heterozygosity was elevated by approximately 3% in crosses raised in ponds compared to those raised in aquaria. Previous results from F1 hybrids in the field suggest that pond-specific (single-locus) heterosis is unlikely to explain this finding. Our study suggests that, in stickleback, a coarse signal of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibilities is reliably detectable and that extrinsic incompatibilities have evolved before intrinsic incompatibilities.",

The ﬁxation of alleles with deleterious pleiotropic side effects causes compensatory alleles to be favored by selection. Such compensatory alleles might segregate in interpopulation hybrids, resulting in segregation variance for traits where parents have indistinguishable phenotypes. If adaptation typically involves pleiotropy and compensation, then the segregation variance for traits under stabilizing selection is expected to increase with the magnitude of adaptive phenotypic divergence between parents. This prediction has not been tested empirically, and I gathered data from experimental hybridization studies to evaluate it. I found that pairs of parents that are more phenotypically divergent beget hybrids with more segregation variance in traits for which the parents are statistically indistinguishable. This result suggests that adaptive divergence between pairs of natural populations proceeds via pleiotropy and compensation and that deleterious transgressive segregation variance accumulates systematically as populations diverge.",

But we know very little about the genetic basis of hybrid fitness, especially in nondomesticated organisms, and when populations are facing environmental stress. We made genetically variable F2 hybrid populations from two divergent Saccharomyces yeast species. We exposed populations to ten toxins and sequenced the most resilient hybrids on low coverage using ddRADseq to investigate four aspects of their genomes: 1) hybridity, 2) interspecific heterozygosity, 3) epistasis (positive or negative associations between nonhomologous chromosomes), and 4) ploidy. We used linear mixed-effect models and simulations to measure to which extent hybrid genome composition was contingent on the environment. Genomes grown in different environments varied in every aspect of hybridness measured, revealing strong genotype–environment interactions. We also found selection against heterozygosity or directional selection for one of the parental alleles, with larger fitness of genomes carrying more homozygous allelic combinations in an otherwise hybrid genomic background. In addition, individual chromosomes and chromosomal interactions showed significant species biases and pervasive aneuploidies. Against our expectations, we observed multiple beneficial, opposite-species chromosome associations, confirmed by epistasis- and selection-free computer simulations, which is surprising given the large divergence of parental genomes (∼15%). Together, these results suggest that successful, stress-resilient hybrid genomes can be assembled from the best features of both parents without paying high costs of negative epistasis. This illustrates the importance of measuring genetic trait architecture in an environmental context when determining the evolutionary potential of genetically diverse hybrid populations.",

However, processes that do not necessarily invoke ongoing selection, such as secondary contact or restricted gene flow, can also cause patterns of phenotypic differentiation over short spatial scales. Distinguishing among all possible scenarios is difficult, but an attainable goal is to establish whether scenarios that imply selection need to be invoked. We compared the extent of morphological and genetic differentiation between geographically structured red and yellow floral races of Mimulus aurantiacus (bush monkeyflower; Phrymacea). Flower color was assessed in a common garden as well as in the field to determine whether variation was genetic and to quantify the extent of geographical differentiation. Population genetic differentiation at marker loci was measured for both chloroplast and nuclear genomes, and the degree of population structure within and among the floral races was evaluated. Flower color shows both a strong genetic basis and a sharp geographic transition, with pure red-flowered populations in western San Diego County and pure yellow-flowered populations to the east. In the zone of contact, both pure and intermediate phenotypes occur. Patterns of genetic differentiation at marker loci are far less pronounced, as little of the variation is partitioned according to the differences in flower color. Phenotypic differentiation (QST) between populations with different flower colors is much greater than neutral genetic differentiation (FST). When comparisons are made between populations of the same flower color, the opposite trend is evident. Limited neutral genetic structure between the floral races, combined with sharp differentiation in flower color, is consistent with the hypothesis that current or recent natural selection maintains the cline in flower color.",

		"abstract": "We tested whether selection by pollinators could explain the parapatric distribution of coastal red- and inland yellow-flowered races of Mimulus aurantiacus (Phrymaceae) by examining visitation to natural and experimental populations. As a first step in evaluating whether indirect selection might explain floral divergence, we also tested for local adaptation in early life stages using a reciprocal transplant experiment. Hummingbirds visited flowers of each race at similar rates in natural populations but showed strong (>95%) preference for red flowers in all habitats in experimental arrays. Hawkmoths demonstrated nearly exclusive (>99% of visits) preference for yellow flowers and only visited in inland regions. Strong preferences for alternative floral forms support a direct role for pollinators in floral divergence. Despite these preferences, measures of plant performance across environments showed that red-flowered plants consistently survived better, grew larger and received more overall pollinator visits than yellow-flowered plants. Unmeasured components of fitness may favour the yellow race in inland habitats. Alternatively, we document a marked recent increase in inland hummingbird density that may have caused a change in the selective environment, favouring the eastward advance of red-flowered plants.",

		"abstract": "Evolutionists have long recognized the role of reproductive isolation in speciation, but the relative contributions of different reproductive barriers are poorly understood. We examined the nature of isolation between Mimulus lewisii and M. cardinalis, sister species of monkeyﬂowers. Studied reproductive barriers include: ecogeographic isolation; pollinator isolation (pollinator ﬁdelity in a natural mixed population); pollen competition (seed set and hybrid production from experimental interspeciﬁc, intraspeciﬁc, and mixed pollinations in the greenhouse); and relative hybrid ﬁtness (germination, survivorship, percent ﬂowering, biomass, pollen viability, and seed mass in the greenhouse). Additionally, the rate of hybridization in nature was estimated from seed collections in a sympatric population. We found substantial reproductive barriers at multiple stages in the life history of M. lewisii and M. cardinalis. Using range maps constructed from herbarium collections, we estimated that the different ecogeographic distributions of the species result in 58.7% reproductive isolation. Mimulus lewisii and M. cardinalis are visited by different pollinators, and in a region of sympatry 97.6% of pollinator foraging bouts were speciﬁc to one species or the other. In the greenhouse, interspeciﬁc pollinations generated nearly 50% fewer seeds than intraspeciﬁc controls. Mixed pollinations of M. cardinalis ﬂowers yielded Ͼ75% parentals even when only one-quarter of the pollen treatment consisted of M. cardinalis pollen. In contrast, both species had similar siring success on M. lewisii ﬂowers. The observed 99.915% occurrence of parental M. lewisii and M. cardinalis in seeds collected from a sympatric population is nearly identical to that expected, based upon our ﬁeld observations of pollinator behavior and our laboratory experiments of pollen competition. F1 hybrids exhibited reduced germination rates, high survivorship and reproduction, and low pollen and ovule fertility. In aggregate, the studied reproductive barriers prevent, on average, 99.87% of gene ﬂow, with most reproductive isolation occurring prior to hybrid formation. Our results suggest that ecological factors resulting from adaptive divergence are the primary isolating barriers in this system. Additional studies of taxa at varying degrees of evolutionary divergence are needed to identify the relative importance of pre- and postzygotic isolating mechanisms in speciation.",

		"abstract": "Plant roots play a signiﬁcant role in plant growth by exploiting soil resources via the uptake of water and nutrients. Root traits such as ﬁne root diameter, speciﬁc root length, speciﬁc root area, root angle, and root length density are considered useful traits for improving plant productivity under drought conditions. Therefore, understanding interactions between roots and their surrounding soil environment is important, which can be improved through root phenotyping. With the advancement in technologies, many tools have been developed for root phenotyping. Canopy temperature depression (CTD) has been considered a good technique for ﬁeld phenotyping of crops under drought and is used to estimate crop yield as well as root traits in relation to drought tolerance. Both laboratory and ﬁeld-based methods for phenotyping root traits have been developed including soil sampling, mini-rhizotron, rhizotrons, thermography and non-soil techniques. Recently, a non-invasive approach of X-ray computed tomography (CT) has provided a break-through to study the root architecture in three dimensions (3-D). This review summarizes methods for root phenotyping. On the basis of this review, it can be concluded that root traits are useful characters to be included in future breeding programs and for selecting better cultivars to increase crop yield under water-limited environments.",

The aims of this work were to assess the main limitations on offspring performance of Silene ciliata, a high mountain Mediterranean plant, and to test whether local adaptation at small spatial scales has a significant effect on the success of establishment.Reciprocal sowing experiments were carried out among three populations of the species to test for evidence of local adaptation on seedling emergence, survival and size. Studied populations were located at the southernmost margin of the species' range, along the local elevation gradient that leads to a drought stress gradient.Drought stress in summer was the main cause of seedling mortality even though germination mainly occurred immediately after snowmelt to make the best use of soil moisture. The results support the hypothesis that species perform better at the centre of their altitudinal range than at the boundaries. Evidence was also found of local adaptation in seedling survival and growth along the whole gradient.The local adaptation acting on seedling emergence and survival favours the persistence of remnant populations on the altitudinal and latitudinal margins of mountain species. In a global warming context, such processes may help to counteract the contraction of this species' ranges and the consequent loss of habitat area.",

		"abstract": "The metaphor of ‘genomic islands of speciation’ was ﬁrst used to describe heterogeneous differentiation among loci between the genomes of closely related species. The biological model proposed to explain these differences was that the regions showing high levels of differentiation were resistant to gene ﬂow between species, while the remainder of the genome was being homogenized by gene ﬂow and consequently showed lower levels of differentiation. However, the conditions under which such differentiation can occur at multiple unlinked loci are restrictive; additionally, essentially, all previous analyses have been carried out using relative measures of divergence, which can be misleading when regions with different levels of recombination are compared. Here, we test the model of differential gene ﬂow by asking whether absolute divergence is also higher in the previously identiﬁed ‘islands’. Using ﬁve species pairs for which full sequence data are available, we ﬁnd that absolute measures of divergence are not higher in genomic islands. Instead, in all cases examined, we ﬁnd reduced diversity in these regions, a consequence of which is that relative measures of divergence are abnormally high. These data therefore do not support a model of differential gene ﬂow among loci, although islands of relative divergence may represent loci involved in local adaptation. Simulations using the program IMa2 further suggest that inferences of any gene ﬂow may be incorrect in many comparisons. We instead present an alternative explanation for heterogeneous patterns of differentiation, one in which postspeciation selection generates patterns consistent with multiple aspects of the data.",

		"abstract": "A fundamental goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the molecular changes responsible for adaptive evolution. In this study, we describe a genetic analysis to determine whether the molecular changes contributing to adaptive flower color divergence in Mimulus aurantiacus affect gene expression or enzymatic activity. High performance liquid chromatography analysis confirms that flower color differences are caused by the presence versus absence of anthocyanin pigments. Cosegregation analysis and in vitro enzymatic assays rule out mutations that affect enzymatic function in the anthocyanin pathway genes. By contrast, cosegregation of gene expression with flower color suggests that tissue-specific differences in pigment production are caused by the coordinated regulatory control of three anthocyanin pathway genes. We provide evidence indicating that these expression differences are caused by a locus that acts in trans- and explains 45% of the phenotypic variance in flower color. A second locus with sequence similarity to the R2R3 MYB family of transcription factors explains 9% of the variation but does so in a complex fashion. These results demonstrate one of only two examples where we have clear evidence of both the adaptive nature of a flower color transition and evidence for its genetic basis. In both cases, mutations appear to affect expression of the anthocyanin structural genes. Future studies will allow us to determine whether these differences represent a real bias in favor of mutations that affect gene expression.",

		"abstract": "Parental imbalances in the endosperm leading to impaired development and eventual hybrid seed failure are common causes of postzygotic isolation in ﬂowering plants. Endosperm sensitivity to parental dosage is reﬂected by canonical phenotypes of “parental excess” in reciprocal interploid crosses. Moreover, parental-excess traits are also evident in many homoploid interspeciﬁc crosses, potentially reﬂecting among-lineage variation in “effective ploidy” driven by endosperm properties. However, the genetic basis of effective ploidy is unknown and genome-wide expression perturbations in parental-excess endosperms from homoploid crosses have yet to be reported. The tomato clade (Solanum section Lycopersicon), encompassing closely related diploids with partial-tocomplete hybrid seed failure, provides outstanding opportunities to study these issues. Here, we compared replicated endosperm transcriptomes from six crosses within and among three wild tomato lineages. Strikingly, strongly inviable hybrid crosses displayed conspicuous, asymmetric expression perturbations that mirror previously characterized parental-excess phenotypes. Solanum peruvianum, the species inferred to have evolved higher effective ploidy than the other two, drove expression landscape polarization between maternal and paternal roles. This global expression divergence was mirrored in functionally important gene families such as MADS-box transcription factors and E3 ubiquitin ligases, and revealed differences in cell cycle tuning that match phenotypic differences in developing endosperm and mature seed size between reciprocal crosses. Our work starts to uncover the complex interactions between expression divergence, parental conﬂict, and hybrid seed failure that likely contributed to plant diversity.",

		"abstract": "Many forms of reproductive isolation contribute to speciation, and early-acting barriers may be especially important, because they have the first opportunity to limit gene flow. Ecogeographic isolation occurs when intrinsic traits of taxa contribute to disjunct geographic distributions, reducing the frequency of intertaxon mating. Characterizing this form of isolation requires knowledge of both the geographic arrangement of suitable habitats in nature and the identification of phenotypes involved in shaping geographic distributions. In Mimulus aurantiacus, red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes are incompletely isolated by divergent selection exerted by different pollinators. However, these emerging taxa are largely isolated spatially, with a hybrid zone occurring along a narrow region of contact. In order to assess whether responses to abiotic conditions contribute to the parapatric distribution of ecotypes, we measured a series of ecophysiological traits from populations along a transect, including drought sensitivity, leaf area and the concentrations of vegetative flavonoids. In contrast to the abrupt transitions in floral phenotypes, we found that ecophysiological traits exhibited a continuous geographic transition that largely mirrors variation in climatological variables. These traits may impede gene flow across a continuous environmental gradient, but they would be unlikely to result in ecotypic divergence alone. Nevertheless, we found a genetic correlation between vegetative and floral traits, providing a potential link between the two forms of isolation. Although neither barrier appears sufficient to cause divergence on its own, the combined impacts of local adaptation to abiotic conditions and regional adaptation to pollinators may interact to drive discontinuous variation in the face of gene flow in this system.",

		"abstract": "Molecular population genetics aims to explain genetic variation and molecular evolution from population genetics principles. The field was born 50 years ago with the first measures of genetic variation in allozyme loci, continued with the nucleotide sequencing era, and is currently in the era of population genomics. During this period, molecular population genetics has been revolutionized by progress in data acquisition and theoretical developments. The conceptual elegance of the neutral theory of molecular evolution or the footprint carved by natural selection on the patterns of genetic variation are two examples of the vast number of inspiring findings of population genetics research. Since the inception of the field, Drosophila has been the prominent model species: molecular variation in populations was first described in Drosophila and most of the population genetics hypotheses were tested in Drosophila species. In this review, we describe the main concepts, methods, and landmarks of molecular population genetics, using the Drosophila model as a reference. We describe the different genetic data sets made available by advances in molecular technologies, and the theoretical developments fostered by these data. Finally, we review the results and new insights provided by the population genomics approach, and conclude by enumerating challenges and new lines of inquiry posed by increasingly large population scale sequence data.",

		"abstract": "Divergent selection applied to one or more traits drives local adaptation and may lead to ecological speciation. Divergent selection on many traits might be termed “multidimensional” divergent selection. There is a commonly held view that multidimensional divergent selection is likely to promote local adaptation and speciation to a greater extent than unidimensional divergent selection. We disentangle the core concepts underlying dimensionality as a property of the environment, phenotypes, and genome. In particular, we identify a need to separate the overall strength of selection and the number of loci affected from dimensionality per se, and to distinguish divergence dimensionality from dimensionality of stabilizing selection. We then critically scrutinize this commonly held view that multidimensional selection promotes speciation, re-examining the evidence base from theory, experiments, and nature. We conclude that the evidence base is currently weak and generally suffers from confounding of possible causal effects. Finally, we propose several mechanisms by which multidimensional divergent selection and related processes might influence divergence, both as a driver and as a barrier.",

Lifetime fitness of a group of males in this population was estimated, and partitioned into five components: lifespan, attendance at the mating area, number of females courted, number of copulations attempted, and number of females inseminated. Three phenotypic characters were measured-elytral length, hom length, and weight; there were strong positive correlations among the three characters. Selection was estimated by regressing each component of fitness on the phenotypic traits. Of the three traits, only hom length was under significant direct selection. This selection was for longer horns and was due mainly to differences in lifespan and access to females. The positive selection on hom length combined with the positive correlations between hom length and the other two characters resulted in positive total selection on all three characters.",

However, most studies view each divergent environment as homogenous, thereby overlooking the potential role within-environment variation plays in RI between differentiating lineages. Here, we test the importance of microenvironmental variation in RI by using individual trees of two host plants, each harboring locally adapted populations of the cynipid wasp Belonocnema treatae. We compared the fitness surrogate (survival) of offspring from hybrid crosses with resident crosses across individual trees on each of two primary host plants, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata. We found evidence of weak hybrid inviability between host-associated lineages of B. treatae despite strong genomic differentiation. However, averaging across environments masked great variation in hybrid fitness on individual trees, where hybrids performed worse than, equal to, or better than residents. Thus, considering the environmental context of hybridization is critical to improving the predictability of divergence under variable selection.",

Here we attempted to estimate the effects of ف50,000 marker haplotypes simultaneously from a limited number of phenotypic records. A genome of 1000 cM was simulated with a marker spacing of 1 cM. The markers surrounding every 1-cM region were combined into marker haplotypes. Due to ﬁnite population size (Ne ϭ 100), the marker haplotypes were in linkage disequilibrium with the QTL located between the markers. Using least squares, all haplotype effects could not be estimated simultaneously. When only the biggest effects were included, they were overestimated and the accuracy of predicting genetic values of the offspring of the recorded animals was only 0.32. Best linear unbiased prediction of haplotype effects assumed equal variances associated to each 1-cM chromosomal segment, which yielded an accuracy of 0.73, although this assumption was far from true. Bayesian methods that assumed a prior distribution of the variance associated with each chromosome segment increased this accuracy to 0.85, even when the prior was not correct. It was concluded that selection on genetic values predicted from markers could substantially increase the rate of genetic gain in animals and plants, especially if combined with reproductive techniques to shorten the generation interval.",

GrowScreen-PaGe allows the acquisition of time series of the developing root systems of 500 plants, thereby enabling to quantify short-term variations in root system. The choice of germination paper was found to be crucial and paper Â root interaction should be considered when comparing data from different studies on germination paper. The system is suitable for phenotyping dicot and monocot plant species. The potential of the system for high-throughput phenotyping was shown by investigating phenotypic diversity of root traits in a collection of 180 rapeseed accessions and of 52 barley genotypes grown under control and nutrient-starved conditions. Most traits showed a large variation linked to both genotype and treatment. In general, root length traits contributed more than shape and branching related traits in separating the genotypes. Overall, results showed that GrowScreen-PaGe will be a powerful resource to investigate root systems and root plasticity of large sets of plants and to explore the molecular and genetic root traits of various species including for crop improvement programs.",

		"abstract": "Gene flow between populations adapting to differing local environmental conditions creates a \"migration load\" because individuals might disperse to habitats where their survival is low or because they might reproduce with locally maladapted individuals. The amount by which the mean relative population fitness is kept below one creates an opportunity for modifiers of the genetic architecture to spread due to selection. Prior work that separately considered modifiers changing dispersal or recombination rates, or altering dominance or epistasis, has typically focused on the direction of selection rather than its absolute magnitude. We here develop methods to determine the strength of selection on modifiers of the genetic architecture, including modifiers of the dispersal rate, after populations evolved local adaptation. We consider scenarios with up to five loci contributing to local adaptation and derive a matrix model for the deterministic spread of modifiers. We find that selection for modifiers of epistasis and dominance is stronger than selection for decreased recombination, and that selection for partial reductions in recombination are extremely weak, regardless of the number of loci contributing to local adaptation. The spread of modifiers for a reduction in dispersal depends on the number of loci, pre-existing epistasis and extent of migration load. We identify a novel effect, that modifiers of dominance are more strongly selected when they are unlinked to the locus that they modify. Overall, these results help explain population differentiation and reproductive isolation and  provide a benchmark to compare selection on genetic architecture modifiers in finite population sizes and under demographic stochasticity.",

		"abstract": "Closely related species (e.g., sister taxa) often occupy very different ecological niches and can exhibit large differences in geographic distributions despite their shared evolutionary history. Budding speciation is one process that may partially explain how differences in niche and distribution characteristics may rapidly evolve. Budding speciation is the process through which new species form as initially small colonizing populations that acquire reproductive isolation. This mode of species formation predicts that, at the time of speciation, sister species should have highly asymmetrical distributions. We tested this hypothesis in North American monkeyflowers, a diverse clade with a robust phylogeny, using data on geographical ranges, climate, and plant community attributes. We found that recently diverged sister pairs have highly asymmetrical ranges and niche breadths, relative to older sister pairs. Additionally, we found that sister species occupy distinct environmental niche positions, and that 80% of sister species have completely or partially overlapping distributions (i.e., are broadly sympatric). Together, these results suggest that budding speciation has occurred frequently in Mimulus, that it has likely taken place both inside the range and on the range periphery, and that observed divergences in habitat and resource use could be associated with speciation in small populations.",

		"abstract": "The interplay of divergent selection and gene flow is key to understanding how populations adapt to local environments and how new species form. Here, we use DNA polymorphism data and genome-wide variation in recombination rate to jointly infer the strength and timing of selection, as well as the baseline level of gene flow under various demographic scenarios. We model how divergent selection leads to a genome-wide negative correlation between recombination rate and genetic differentiation among populations. Our theory shows that the selection density (i.e., the selection coefficient per base pair) is a key parameter underlying this relationship. We then develop a procedure for parameter estimation that accounts for the confounding effect of background selection. Applying this method to two datasets from\n              Mimulus guttatus\n              , we infer a strong signal of adaptive divergence in the face of gene flow between populations growing on and off phytotoxic serpentine soils. However, the genome-wide intensity of this selection is not exceptional compared with what\n              M. guttatus\n              populations may typically experience when adapting to local conditions. We also find that selection against genome-wide introgression from the selfing sister species\n              M. nasutus\n              has acted to maintain a barrier between these two species over at least the last 250 ky. Our study provides a theoretical framework for linking genome-wide patterns of divergence and recombination with the underlying evolutionary mechanisms that drive this differentiation.",

		"abstract": "The study of nearly 400 syntype, other type, and probable type elements of Crataegus, in the context of over 4000 other Missouri specimens examined for the Flora of Missouri Project, provided a unique opportunity to look at putative hybridization in the Missouri Crataegus flora. These specimens collectively represent essentially all the taxonomic variation observed to date for the state. Each type specimen was studied and then categorized as being either: (a) a primary species (orthospecies); (b) a synonym of an orthospecies; or (c) representing a wide hybrid (nothospecies). These nothospecies, all putative, constitute the totality of alleged hybrids for Missouri. Computation of hybrid frequency yielded the conclusion that wide hybrids occur between about 15% of the possible interserial combinations, and field and herbarium studies show that populations of these hybrids are usually small and non-persistent. Working with weaker data, roughly similar results were generated for the whole of the Crataegus-rich northeastern quadrant of the United States (and adjacent Canada). Interestingly, the very small surviving, or even extinct, nature of the populations of these hybrids, together with their high reliability of correct identification, indicate that known hybrids do not contribute significantly to \"The Crataegus Problem\" routinely touted by North American authors.",

		"abstract": "Reinforcement is an evolutionary process whereby increased prezygotic reproductive isolation evolves in response to the cost of hybridization. Despite theory predicting that multiple prezygotic barriers can evolve via reinforcement, most empirical studies examine a single barrier. We test novel predictions for the reinforcement of both habitat isolation and sexual isolation between ecologically divergent lineages under asymmetric migration: the lineage that emigrates more should evolve stronger habitat isolation due to the lower fitness of immigrants in the alternative habitat, while the lineage that receives more immigrants should exhibit stronger sexual isolation due to the lower fitness of hybrids. We found both signatures of reinforcement in two sympatric sister species of gall wasps that are host specific to the southern live oaks, Quercus virginiana and Q. geminata, respectively. Specifically, we observed stronger habitat isolation in the species with higher emigration rates, Belonocnema treatae, and stronger sexual isolation in the species facing more immigrants, B. fossoria. In contrast, comparisons of both species to a third, allopatric, species showed that B. kinseyi exhibited both lower habitat isolation and sexual isolation than the sympatric species, consistent with the classic predictions of reinforcement. Our study provides a rare examination of the interplay of ecology and geography in the evolution of multiple reproductive barriers to gene flow. Given that asymmetric migration between ecologically divergent lineages increasingly appears to be the rule rather than the exception, concomitant asymmetries in the strength of habitat and sexual isolation could be more widespread than currently understood.",

		"abstract": "A primary goal in evolutionary biology is to identify the historical events that have facilitated the origin and spread of adaptations. When these adaptations also lead to reproductive isolation, we can learn about the evolutionary mechanisms contributing to speciation. We reveal the complex history of the gene MaMyb2 in shaping flower colour divergence within a recent radiation of monkeyflowers. In the Mimulus aurantiacus species complex, red-flowered M. a. ssp. puniceus and yellow-flowered M. a. ssp. australis are partially isolated because of differences in pollinator preferences. Phylogenetic analyses based on genome-wide variation across the complex suggest two origins of red flowers from a yellow-flowered ancestor: one in M. a. ssp. puniceus and one in M. a. ssp. flemingii. However, in both cases, red flowers are caused by cis-regulatory mutations in the gene MaMyb2. Although this could be due to distinct mutations in each lineage, we show that the red allele in M. a. ssp. puniceus did not evolve de novo or exist as standing variation in its yellow-flowered ancestor. Rather, our results suggest that a single red MaMyb2 allele evolved during the radiation of M. aurantiacus that was subsequently transferred to the yellow-flowered ancestor of M. a. ssp. puniceus via introgressive hybridization. Because gene flow is still possible among taxa, we conclude that introgressive hybridization can be a potent driver of adaptation at the early stages of divergence that can contribute to the origins of biodiversity.",

		"abstract": "Although cultivated grapevines (Vitis vinifera L.) were domesticated from their closest relative in Central Asia, grape wild relatives from North America are vital due to their use as grafted rootstocks. Rootstocks derived from North American Vitis species are critical to the global wine, table, and raisin grape industries for resistance to the root pest phylloxera (Daktulosphaira vitifoliae). These rootstocks can also provide other benefits such as cold and drought tolerance, nematode and disease resistance, and control over vigor and phenology. Phylogenetic studies of the many Vitis species native to North America often disagree on the number of species and their boundaries, specifically in the Southwestern United States and Mexico. The wild vines are all dioecious and, with the exception of subgenus Muscadinia Planchon, interfertile – allowing for interspecific hybridization wherever ranges overlap. A better understanding of the relationships between North American Vitis species is needed to identify gaps in the current ex situ germplasm collections. Additionally, efforts must be made to safeguard dwindling populations of some species in their native environments. Conservation of these valuable genetic resources will ensure that grape breeders throughout the world have the necessary diversity to adapt to a changing environment.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid viability decreases with divergence time, a pattern consistent with a so-called speciation clock. However, the actual rate at which this clock ticks is poorly known. Most speciation-clock studies have used genetic divergence as a proxy for time, adopting a molecular clock and often far-distant calibration points to convert genetic distances into age. Because molecular clock assumptions are violated for most genetic datasets and distant calibrations are of questionable utility, the actual rate at which reproductive isolation evolves may be substantially different than current estimates suggest. We provide a robust measure of the tempo at which hybrid viability declines with divergence time in a clade of freshwater fishes (Centrarchidae). This incompatibility clock is distinct from a speciation clock because speciation events in centrarchids appear to be driven largely by prezygotic isolation. Our analyses used divergence times estimated with penalized likelihood applied to a phylogeny derived from seven gene regions and calibrated with six centrarchid fossils. We found that hybrid embryo viability declined at mean rate of 3.13% per million years, slower than in most other taxa investigated to date. Despite measurement error in both molecular estimated ages and hatching success of hybrid crosses, divergence time explained between 73% and 90% of the variation in hybrid viability among nodes. This high correlation is consistent with the gradual accumulation of many genetic incompatibilities of small effect. Hybrid viability declined with the square of time, consistent with an increasing rate of accumulation of incompatibilities between divergent genomes (the snowball effect). However, the quadratic slope is due to a lag phase resulting from heterosis among young species pairs, a phenomenon rarely considered in predictions of hybrid fitness. Finally, we found that reciprocal crosses often show asymmetrical hybrid viabilities. We discuss several alternative explanations for this result including possible deleterious cytonuclear interactions. Speciation-clock studies have been a small cottage industry recently, but there are still novel insights to be gained from analyses of more taxonomic groups. However, between-group comparisons require more careful molecular-clock calibration than has been the norm.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid incompatibilities occur when interactions between opposite ancestry alleles at different loci reduce the fitness of hybrids. Most work on incompatibilities has focused on those that are “intrinsic,” meaning they affect viability and sterility in the laboratory. Theory predicts that ecological selection can also underlie hybrid incompatibilities, but tests of this hypothesis using sequence data are scarce. In this article, we compiled genetic data for F2 hybrid crosses between divergent populations of threespine stickleback fish (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) that were born and raised in either the field (seminatural experimental ponds) or the laboratory (aquaria). Because selection against incompatibilities results in elevated ancestry heterozygosity, we tested the prediction that ancestry heterozygosity will be higher in pond-raised fish compared to those raised in aquaria. We found that ancestry heterozygosity was elevated by approximately 3% in crosses raised in ponds compared to those raised in aquaria. Additional analyses support a phenotypic basis for incompatibility and suggest that environment-specific single-locus heterozygote advantage is not the cause of selection on ancestry heterozygosity. Our study provides evidence that, in stickleback, a coarse—albeit indirect—signal of environment-dependent hybrid incompatibility is reliably detectable and suggests that extrinsic incompatibilities can evolve before intrinsic incompatibilities.",

		"abstract": "Low-coverage whole genome sequencing (lcWGS) has emerged as a powerful and cost-effective approach for population genomic studies in both model and nonmodel species. However, with read depths too low to confidently call individual genotypes, lcWGS requires specialized analysis tools that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty. A growing number of such tools have become available, but it can be difficult to get an overview of what types of analyses can be performed reliably with lcWGS data, and how the distribution of sequencing effort between the number of samples analysed and per-sample sequencing depths affects inference accuracy. In this introductory guide to lcWGS, we first illustrate how the per-sample cost for lcWGS is now comparable to RAD-seq and Pool-seq in many systems. We then provide an overview of software packages that explicitly account for genotype uncertainty in different types of population genomic inference. Next, we use both simulated and empirical data to assess the accuracy of allele frequency, genetic diversity, and linkage disequilibrium estimation, detection of population structure, and selection scans under different sequencing strategies. Our results show that spreading a given amount of sequencing effort across more samples with lower depth per sample consistently improves the accuracy of most types of inference, with a few notable exceptions. Finally, we assess the potential for using imputation to bolster inference from lcWGS data in nonmodel species, and discuss current limitations and future perspectives for lcWGS-based population genomics research. With this overview, we hope to make lcWGS more approachable and stimulate its broader adoption.",

		"abstract": "In contrast to ecological speciation, where reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent natural selection, speciation by parallel natural selection has been less thoroughly studied. To test whether parallel evolution drives speciation, we leveraged the repeated evolution of benthic and limnetic ecotypes of threespine stickleback fish and estimated fitness for pure crosses and within-ecotype hybrids in semi-natural ponds and in laboratory aquaria. In ponds, we detected hybrid breakdown in both ecotypes but this was counterbalanced by heterosis and the strength of post-zygotic isolation was nil. In aquaria, we detected heterosis only in limnetic crosses and breakdown in neither ecotype, suggesting that hybrid incompatibilities are environment-dependent for both ecotypes and that heterosis is environment-dependent in benthic crosses. Heterosis and breakdown were 3× greater in limnetic crosses than in benthic crosses, contrasting the prediction that the fitness consequences of hybridization should be greater in crosses among more derived ecotypes. Consistent with a primary role for stochastic processes, patterns differed among crosses between populations from different lakes. Yet, we observed qualitatively similar patterns of heterosis and hybrid breakdown in benthic crosses and limnetic crosses when averaging the lake pairs, suggesting that the outcome of hybridization is repeatable in a general sense.",

		"abstract": "Ecological adaptation is the driving force during divergence with gene flow and generates reproductive isolation early in speciation. Although gene flow opposes divergence, local adaptation can be facilitated by factors that prevent the breakup of favorable allelic combinations. We investigated how selection, genetic architecture, and geography have contributed to the maintenance of floral trait divergence and pollinator isolation between parapatric ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Combining greenhouse, field, and genomic studies, we show that sharp clines in floral traits are maintained by spatially varying selection. Although adaptation breaks down where the ecotypes co-occur, leading to the formation of a hybrid zone, the largely non-overlapping distributions of the ecotypes shield them from immigrant genes, facilitating divergence across most of the range. In contrast to the sharp genetic discontinuities observed across most hybrid zones, we observed a gradual cline in genome-wide divergence and a pattern of isolation by distance across the landscape. Thus, contrary to a long period of allopatry followed by recent re-contact, our data suggest that floral trait divergence in M. aurantiacus may have evolved with locally restricted, but ongoing gene flow. Therefore, our study reveals how the geographic distribution of an organism can contribute to the evolution of premating isolation in the early stages of divergence with gene flow.",

As with many areas in genetics, advances in molecular techniques and statistics are drastically altering how we can investigate inheritance in wild organisms. For ecology and evolution, this is particularly significant and promising, because many of the organisms of interest are not amenable to conventional genetic approaches. Admixture mapping falls within a family of statistical approaches that use natural recombination and linkage disequilibrium between genetic markers and phenotypes as the basis for mapping. Our aim in this review is to provide a snapshot of previous and ongoing research, existing methods and challenges, the nature of questions that can be investigated and prospects for the future of admixture mapping.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization between species is widespread across the tree of life. As a result, many species, including our own, harbor regions of their genome derived from hybridization. Despite the recognition that this process is widespread, we understand little about how the genome stabilizes following hybridization, and whether the mechanisms driving this stabilization tend to be shared across species. Here, we dissect the drivers of variation in local ancestry across the genome in replicated hybridization events between two species pairs of swordtail fish: Xiphophorus birchmanni × X. cortezi and X. birchmanni × X. malinche. We find surprisingly high levels of repeatability in local ancestry across the two types of hybrid populations. This repeatability is attributable in part to the fact that the recombination landscape and locations of functionally important elements play a major role in driving variation in local ancestry in both types of hybrid populations. Beyond these broad scale patterns, we identify dozens of regions of the genome where minor parent ancestry is unusually low or high across species pairs. Analysis of these regions points to shared sites under selection across species pairs, and in some cases, shared mechanisms of selection. We show that one such region is a previously unknown hybrid incompatibility that is shared across X. birchmanni × X. cortezi and X. birchmanni × X. malinche hybrid populations.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid zones have been promoted as windows on the evolutionary process and as laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. Patterns of divergence between hybridizing species can now be characterized on a genomewide scale, and recent genome scans have focused on the presence of ‘islands’ of divergence. Patterns of heterogeneous genomic divergence may reflect differential introgression following secondary contact and provide insights into which genome regions contribute to local adaptation, hybrid unfitness and positive assortative mating. However, heterogeneous genome divergence can also arise in the absence of any gene flow, as a result of variation in selection and recombination across the genome. We suggest that to understand hybrid zone origins and dynamics, it is essential to distinguish between genome regions that are divergent between pure parental populations and regions that show restricted introgression where these populations interact in hybrid zones. The latter, more so than the former, reveal the likely genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. Mosaic hybrid zones, because of their complex structure and multiple contacts, are particularly good subjects for distinguishing primary intergradation from secondary contact. Comparisons among independent hybrid zones or transects that involve the ‘same’ species pair can also help to distinguish between divergence with gene flow and secondary contact. However, data from replicate hybrid zones or replicate transects do not reveal consistent patterns; in a few cases, patterns of introgression are similar across independent transects, but for many taxa, there is distinct lack of concordance, presumably due to variation in environmental context and/or variation in the genetics of the interacting populations.",

Little is known about how pre- and postzygotic barriers will affect the prospects of ‘‘admixture mapping’’ in wild species. We have studied 93 mapped genetic markers (microsatellites, indels, and sequence polymorphisms, $60,000 data points) to address this topic in hybrid zones of Populus alba and P. tremula, two widespread, ecologically important forest trees. Using genotype and linkage information and recently developed analytical tools we show that (1) reproductive isolation between these species is much stronger than previously assumed but this cannot prevent the introgression of neutral or advantageous alleles, (2) unexpected genotypic gaps exist between recombinant hybrids and their parental taxa, (3) these conspicuous genotypic patterns are due to assortative mating and strong postzygotic barriers, rather than recent population history. We discuss possible evolutionary trajectories of hybrid lineages between these species and outline strategies for admixture mapping in hybrid zones between highly divergent populations. Datasets such as this one are still rare in studies of natural hybrid zones but should soon become more common as high throughput genotyping and resequencing become feasible in nonmodel species.",

		"abstract": "All genes interact with other genes, and their additive effects and epistatic interactions affect an organism's phenotype and fitness. Recent theoretical and empirical work has advanced our understanding of the role of multi-locus interactions in speciation. However, relating different models to one another and to empirical observations is challenging. This review focuses on multi-locus interactions that lead to reproductive isolation (RI) through reduced hybrid fitness. We first review theoretical approaches and show how recent work incorporating a mechanistic understanding of multi-locus interactions recapitulates earlier models, but also makes novel predictions concerning the build-up of RI. These include high variance in the build-up rate of RI among taxa, the emergence of strong incompatibilities producing localized barriers to introgression, and an effect of population size on the build-up of RI. We then review recent experimental approaches to detect multi-locus interactions underlying RI using genomic data. We argue that future studies would benefit from overlapping methods like ancestry disequilibrium scans, genome scans of differentiation and analyses of hybrid gene expression. Finally, we highlight a need for further overlap between theoretical and empirical work, and approaches that predict what kind of patterns multi-locus interactions resulting in incompatibilities will leave in genome-wide polymorphism data.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Speciation, that is, the evolution of reproductive barriers eventually leading to complete isolation, is a crucial process generating biodiversity. Recent work has contributed much to our understanding of how reproductive barriers begin to evolve, and how they are maintained in the face of gene flow. However, little is known about the transition from partial to strong reproductive isolation (RI) and the completion of speciation. We argue that the evolution of strong RI is likely to involve different processes, or new interactions among processes, compared with the evolution of the first reproductive barriers. Transition to strong RI may be brought about by changing external conditions, for example, following secondary contact. However, the increasing levels of RI themselves create opportunities for new barriers to evolve and, and interaction or coupling among barriers. These changing processes may depend on genomic architecture and leave detectable signals in the genome. We outline outstanding questions and suggest more theoretical and empirical work, considering both patterns and processes associated with strong RI, is needed to understand how speciation is completed.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers'.",

This study dissected the genetic control of ELWL in wheat, associated physiological, morphological and anatomical leaf traits, and compared these with yield QTLs.\n\nMethods\nNinety-four hexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) doubled haploids, mapped with over 700 markers, were tested for three years for ELWL from detached leaf 4 of glasshouse-grown plants. In one experiment, stomata per unit area and leaf thickness parameters from leaf cross-sections were measured. QTLs were identified using QTLCartographer.\n\nResults\nELWL was significantly negatively correlated with leaf length, width, area and thickness. Major QTLs for ELWL during 0–3 h and 3–6 h were coincident across trials on 3A, 3B, 4B, 5B, 5D, 6B, 7A, 7B, 7D and frequently coincident (inversely) with leaf size QTLs. Yield in other trials was sometimes associated with ELWL and leaf size phenotypically and genotypically, but more frequently under non-droughted than droughted conditions. QTL coincidence showed only ELWL to be associated with drought/control yield ratio.\n\nDiscussion\nOur results demonstrated that measures of ELWL and leaf size were equally effective predictors of yield, and both were more useful for selecting under favourable than stressed conditions.",

Fully-developed leaves were detached and placed in a closed plastic box containing a salt solution to control the atmospheric water potential in the container. Three hours of dehydration (weight loss of the leaf) was optimal for measuring changes in stomatal response to dehydration. Application of the plant hormone abscisic acid (ABA) prior to leaf detachment decreased the amount of water loss, indicating that the assay was able to detect differences based on a stomatal response to dehydration. Five different Vitis genotypes (V. riparia, V. champinii, V. vinifera cv. Shiraz, V. vinifera cv. Grenache and V. vinifera cv. Cabernet Sauvignon) with known differences in drought tolerance were screened for their dehydration response and the results obtained corresponded to previous reports of stomatal responses in the vineyard. Significant differences in stomatal density along with differences in the amount and rate of water lost indicate differences in dehydration sensitivity among the genotypes screened. Differences in stomatal response to ABA were also detected. Shiraz had the lowest stomatal density and the highest ABA sensitivity among the genotypes screened, yet Shiraz lost the most amount of water, indicating that it was the least sensitive to dehydration. Despite having the highest stomatal density and intermediate stomatal sensitivity to ABA, V. riparia lost the smallest amount of water, indicating that it was the most sensitive to dehydration. The assay presented here represents a simple and reliable phenotyping method for plant responses to leaf dehydration.",

It is a complete summary of sequence variation at unlinked sites and more generally, its shape reﬂects underlying population genetic processes. One practical challenge is that inferring the SFS from low coverage sequencing data in a straightforward manner by using genotype calls can lead to signiﬁcant bias. To reduce bias, previous studies have used a statistical method that directly estimates the SFS from sequencing data by ﬁrst computing site allele frequency (SAF) likelihood for each site (i.e. the likelihood a site has each possible allele frequency conditional on observed sequence reads) using a dynamic programming (DP) algorithm. Although this method produces an accurate SFS, computing the SAF likelihood is quadratic in the number of samples sequenced.",

The common approach is to study historical signatures of selection in populations already well adapted to different environments. Here, to document selection under natural conditions, we study six populations of threespine stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) inhabiting bar-built estuaries that undergo seasonal cycles of environmental changes. Estuaries are periodically isolated from the ocean due to sandbar formation during dry summer months, with concurrent environmental shifts that resemble the long-term changes associated with postglacial colonization of freshwater habitats by marine populations. We used pooled whole-genome sequencing to track seasonal allele frequency changes in six of these populations and search for signatures of natural selection. We found consistent changes in allele frequency across estuaries, suggesting a potential role for parallel selection. Functional enrichment among candidate genes included transmembrane ion transport and calcium binding, which are important for osmoregulation and ion balance. The genomic changes that occur in threespine stickleback from bar-built estuaries could provide a glimpse into the early stages of adaptation that have occurred in many historical marine to freshwater transitions.",

		"abstract": "Background:  For assembling large whole-genome sequence datasets for routine use in research and breeding, the sequencing strategy should be adapted to the methods that will be used later for variant discovery and imputation. In this study, we used simulation to explore the impact that the sequencing strategy and level of sequencing invest‑ment have on the overall accuracy of imputation using hybrid peeling, a pedigree-based imputation method that is well suited for large livestock populations.\nMethods:  We simulated marker array and whole-genome sequence data for 15 populations with simulated or real pedigrees that had different structures. In these populations, we evaluated the effect on imputation accuracy of seven methods for selecting which individuals to sequence, the generation of the pedigree to which the sequenced individuals belonged, the use of variable or uniform coverage, and the trade-off between the number of sequenced individuals and their sequencing coverage. For each population, we considered four levels of investment in sequenc‑ing that were proportional to the size of the population.\nResults:  Imputation accuracy depended greatly on pedigree depth. The distribution of the sequenced individuals across the generations of the pedigree underlay the performance of the different methods used to select individuals to sequence and it was critical for achieving high imputation accuracy in both early and late generations. Imputation accuracy was highest with a uniform coverage across the sequenced individuals of 2× rather than variable coverage. An investment equivalent to the cost of sequencing 2% of the population at 2× provided high imputation accuracy. The gain in imputation accuracy from additional investment decreased with larger populations and higher levels of investment. However, to achieve the same imputation accuracy, a proportionally greater investment must be used in the smaller populations compared to the larger ones.\nConclusions:  Suitable sequencing strategies for subsequent imputation with hybrid peeling involve sequenc‑ing ~2% of the population at a uniform coverage 2×, distributed preferably across all generations of the pedigree, except for the few earliest generations that lack genotyped ancestors. Such sequencing strategies are beneficial for generating whole-genome sequence data in populations with deep pedigrees of closely related individuals.",

		"abstract": "Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are a major component of reproductive isolation between species. DMIs imply negative epistasis, and are exposed when two diverged populations hybridize. Mapping the locations of DMIs has largely relied on classical genetic mapping. Approaches to date are hampered by low power and the challenge of identifying DMI loci on the same chromosome, because strong initial linkage of parental haplotypes weakens statistical tests. Here, we propose new statistics to infer negative epistasis from haplotype frequencies in hybrid populations. When two divergent populations hybridize, the variance in heterozygosity at two loci decreases faster with time at DMI loci than at random pairs of loci. When two populations hybridize at near-even admixture proportions, the deviation of the observed variance from its expectation becomes negative for the DMI pair. This negative deviation enables us to detect intermediate to strong negative epistasis both within and between chromosomes. In practice, the detection window in hybrid populations depends on the demographic scenario, the recombination rate, and the strength of epistasis. When the initial proportion of the two parental populations is uneven, only strong DMIs can be detected with our method unless migration prevents parental haplotypes from being lost. We use the new statistics to infer candidate DMIs from three hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We identify numerous new DMI candidates, some of which are inferred to interact with several loci within and between chromosomes. Moreover, we discuss our results in the context of an expected enrichment in intrachromosomal over interchromosomal DMIs.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the effects of environmental conditions in cooperatively breeding species helps reveal the nature of evolutionary forces leading to this type of social system. In particular, environmental variability may affect demographic processes such as mortality and dispersal which can ultimately define the fine-scale genetic structure of cooperatively breeding populations, including direct and indirect fitness opportunities for individuals. We investigated the population genetic structure and dispersal patterns of obligately cooperative white-winged choughs, Corcorax melanorhamphos, exploring within-group relatedness and genetic differentiation among groups sampled over several years of above average rainfall. We compared our results with data from a previous study in the surrounding area, conducted during a drought period. White-winged chough groups showed similar significant genetic differentiation among groups during both drought and nondrought periods. However, we found female-biased dispersal during abundant rainfall years, which contrasts with the previous study conducted during a drought. We also examined differences in genetic structure in the present study, between groups breeding in suburbs versus native woodlands, finding higher within-group relatedness in woodland birds. Dispersal was female biased in both suburban and woodland habitat but subadult females in suburban habitat were more likely to disperse than adult females. We suggest that higher mortality in chough populations (both during a drought and in suburban habitats) led to more breeding opportunities, resulting in higher dispersal, and reflecting lower group stability. Our study suggests ecological conditions are important drivers of social structure in a cooperatively breeding bird, which are likely to be impacted by environmental change, including climate and urbanization.",

It also can employ internal reference panels, incorporating a subset of individuals from the study sample itself. Internal panels offer an advantage over external panels because they can reduce imputation errors arising from genetic dissimilarity between a population of interest and a second, distinct population from which the external reference panel has been constructed. As the cost of next-generation sequencing decreases, internal reference panel selection is becoming increasingly feasible. However, it is not clear how best to select individuals to include in such panels. We introduce a new method for selecting an internal reference panel—minimizing the average distance to the closest leaf (ADCL)—and compare its performance relative to an earlier algorithm: maximizing phylogenetic diversity (PD). Employing both simulated data and sequences from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show that ADCL provides a signiﬁcant improvement in imputation accuracy, especially for imputation of sites with low-frequency alleles. This improvement in imputation accuracy is robust to changes in reference panel size, marker density, and length of the imputation target region.",

		"abstract": "Landscape genomics is an emerging research field that aims to identify the environmental factors that shape adaptive genetic variation and the gene variants that drive local adaptation. Its development has been facilitated by next-generation sequencing, which allows for screening thousands to millions of single nucleotide polymorphisms in many individuals and populations at reasonable costs. In parallel, data sets describing environmental factors have greatly improved and increasingly become publicly accessible. Accordingly, numerous analytical methods for environmental association studies have been developed. Environmental association analysis identifies genetic variants associated with particular environmental factors and has the potential to uncover adaptive patterns that are not discovered by traditional tests for the detection of outlier loci based on population genetic differentiation. We review methods for conducting environmental association analysis including categorical tests, logistic regressions, matrix correlations, general linear models and mixed effects models. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of different approaches, provide a list of dedicated software packages and their specific properties, and stress the importance of incorporating neutral genetic structure in the analysis. We also touch on additional important aspects such as sampling design, environmental data preparation, pooled and reduced-representation sequencing, candidate-gene approaches, linearity of allele–environment associations and the combination of environmental association analyses with traditional outlier detection tests. We conclude by summarizing expected future directions in the field, such as the extension of statistical approaches, environmental association analysis for ecological gene annotation, and the need for replication and post hoc validation studies.",

		"abstract": "As next-generation sequencing data become increasingly available for non-model organisms, a shift has occurred in the focus of studies of the geographic distribution of genetic variation. Whereas landscape genetics studies primarily focus on testing the effects of landscape variables on gene flow and genetic population structure, landscape genomics studies focus on detecting candidate genes under selection that indicate possible local adaptation. Navigating the transition between landscape genomics and landscape genetics can be challenging. The number of molecular markers analyzed has shifted from what used to be a few dozen loci to thousands of loci and even full genomes. Although genome scale data can be separated into sets of neutral loci for analyses of gene flow and population structure and putative loci under selection for inference of local adaptation, there are inherent differences in the questions that are addressed in the two study frameworks. We discuss these differences and their implications for study design, marker choice and downstream analysis methods. Similar to the rapid proliferation of analysis methods in the early development of landscape genetics, new analytical methods for detection of selection in landscape genomics studies are burgeoning. We focus on genome scan methods for detection of selection, and in particular, outlier differentiation methods and genetic-environment association tests because they are the most widely used. Use of genome scan methods requires an understanding of the potential mismatches between the biology of a species and assumptions inherent in analytical methods used, which can lead to high false positive rates of detected loci under selection. Key to choosing appropriate genome scan methods is an understanding of the underlying demographic structure of study populations, and such data can be obtained using neutral loci from the generated genome-wide data or prior knowledge of a species' phylogeographic history. To this end, we summarize recent simulation studies that test the power and accuracy of genome scan methods under a variety of demographic scenarios and sampling designs. We conclude with a discussion of additional considerations for future method development, and a summary of methods that show promise for landscape genomics studies but are not yet widely used.",

		"abstract": "Landscape genetics integrates theory and analytical methods of population genetics and landscape ecology. Research in this area has increased in recent decades, creating a plethora of options for study design and analysis. Here we present a practical toolbox for the design and analysis of landscape genetics studies following a seven-step framework: (1) define the study objectives, (2) consider the spatial and temporal scale of the study, (3) design a sampling regime, (4) select a genetic marker, (5) generate genetic input data, (6) generate spatial input data, and (7) choose an analytical method that integrates genetic and spatial data. Study design considerations discussed include choices of spatial and temporal scale, sample size and spatial distribution, and genetic marker selection. We present analytical methods suitable for achieving different study objectives. As emerging technologies generate genetic and spatial data sets of increasing size, complexity, and resolution, landscape geneticists are challenged to execute hypothesis-driven research that combines empirical data and simulation modeling. The landscape genetics framework presented here can accommodate new design considerations and analyses, and facilitate integration of genetic and spatial data by guiding new landscape geneticists through study design, implementation, and analysis.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the processes and patterns of gene flow and local adaptation requires a detailed knowledge of how landscape characteristics structure populations. This understanding is crucial, not only for improving ecological knowledge, but also for managing properly the genetic diversity of threatened and endangered populations. For nearly 80 years, population geneticists have investigated how physiognomy and other landscape features have influenced genetic variation within and between populations. They have relied on sampling populations that have been identified beforehand because most population genetics methods have required discrete populations. However, a new approach has emerged for analyzing spatial genetic data without requiring that discrete populations be identified in advance. This approach, landscape genetics, promises to facilitate our understanding of how geographical and environmental features structure genetic variation at both the population and individual levels, and has implications for ecology, evolution and conservation biology. It differs from other genetic approaches, such as phylogeography, in that it tends to focus on processes at finer spatial and temporal scales. Here, we discuss, from a population genetic perspective, the current tools available for conducting studies of landscape genetics.",

		"abstract": "Landscape genetics is a rapidly evolving interdisciplinary field that integrates approaches from population genetics and landscape ecology. In the context of habitat fragmentation, the current focus of landscape genetics is on assessing the degree to which landscapes facilitate the movement of organisms (landscape connectivity) by relating gene-flow patterns to landscape structure. Neutral genetic variation among individuals or direct estimates of current gene flow are statistically related to landscape characteristics such as the presence of hypothesized barriers or the least-cost distance for an organism to move from one habitat patch to another, given the nature of the intervening matrix or habitat types. In the context of global change, a major challenge for landscape genetics is to address the spread of adaptive variation across landscapes. Genome scans combined with genetic sample collection along environmental gradients or in different habitat types attempt to identify molecular markers that are statistically related to specific environmental conditions, indicating adaptive genetic variation. The landscape genetics of adaptive variation may also help answer fundamental questions about the collective evolution of populations.",

		"abstract": "Understanding how landscape heterogeneity constrains gene flow and the spread of adaptive genetic variation is important for biological conservation given current global change. However, the integration of population genetics, landscape ecology and spatial statistics remains an interdisciplinary challenge at the levels of concepts and methods. We present a conceptual framework to relate the spatial distribution of genetic variation to the processes of gene flow and adaptation as regulated by spatial heterogeneity of the environment, while explicitly considering the spatial and temporal dynamics of landscapes, organisms and their genes. When selecting the appropriate analytical methods, it is necessary to consider the effects of multiple processes and the nature of population genetic data. Our framework relates key landscape genetics questions to four levels of analysis: (i) node-based methods, which model the spatial distribution of alleles at sampling locations (nodes) from local site characteristics; these methods are suitable for modeling adaptive genetic variation while accounting for the presence of spatial autocorrelation. (ii) Link-based methods, which model the probability of gene flow between two patches (link) and relate neutral molecular marker data to landscape heterogeneity; these methods are suitable for modeling neutral genetic variation but are subject to inferential problems, which may be alleviated by reducing links based on a network model of the population. (iii) Neighborhood-based methods, which model the connectivity of a focal patch with all other patches in its local neighborhood; these methods provide a link to metapopulation theory and landscape connectivity modeling and may allow the integration of node- and link-based information, but applications in landscape genetics are still limited. (iv) Boundary-based methods, which delineate genetically homogeneous populations and infer the location of genetic boundaries; these methods are suitable for testing for barrier effects of landscape features in a hypothesis-testing framework. We conclude that the power to detect the effect of landscape heterogeneity on the spatial distribution of genetic variation can be increased by explicit consideration of underlying assumptions and choice of an appropriate analytical approach depending on the research question.",

		"abstract": "Understanding how spatial genetic patterns respond to landscape change is crucial for advancing the emerging field of landscape genetics. We quantified the number of generations for new landscape barrier signatures to become detectable and for old signatures to disappear after barrier removal. We used spatially explicit, individual-based simulations to examine the ability of an individual-based statistic [Mantel’s r using the proportion of shared alleles’ statistic (Dps)] and population-based statistic (FST) to detect barriers. We simulated a range of movement strategies including nearest neighbour dispersal, long-distance dispersal and panmixia. The lag time for the signal of a new barrier to become established is short using Mantel’s r (1–15 generations). FST required approximately 200 generations to reach 50% of its equilibrium maximum, although G’ST performed much like Mantel’s r. In strong contrast, FST and Mantel’s r perform similarly following the removal of a barrier formerly dividing a population. Also, given neighbour mating and very short-distance dispersal strategies, historical discontinuities from more than 100 generations ago might still be detectable with either method. This suggests that historical events and landscapes could have long-term effects that confound inferences about the impacts of current landscape features on gene flow for species with very little long-distance dispersal. Nonetheless, populations of organisms with relatively large dispersal distances will lose the signal of a former barrier within less than 15 generations, suggesting that individual-based landscape genetic approaches can improve our ability to measure effects of existing landscape features on genetic structure and connectivity.",

		"abstract": "Under a widely accepted model of pollinator-driven speciation, geographic variation in pollinator assemblage drives floral divergence and automatically causes reproductive isolation. Yet it is unclear whether divergent floral adaptation initially confers strong reproductive isolation, or whether that comes at later stages of speciation and requires other forms of reproductive isolation. This study uses a pair of recently diverged, interfertile and parapatric species in the genus Clarkia to determine whether adaptation to hawkmoths, a novel pollinator functional group, would automatically confer floral isolation upon sympatric contact.First, genetically based differences in floral traits between C. breweri and C. concinna that would be maintained upon migration are quantified. Then scenarios of experimental sympatry are constructed in which arrays of flowers are exposed to the novel pollinator, the hawkmoth Hyles lineata, and pollinator preference and heterospecific pollen transfer are assessed. Source populations from across the ranges of each species are used to understand how geographic variation in floral traits within species may affect floral isolation.Although H. lineata has never been observed visiting C. concinna in the wild, it regularly moves between species in experimental floral arrays. Hawkmoth preference and heterospecific pollen transfer vary both among moths and among geographic source locations of C. concinna. The strength of floral isolation in this system is related to variation in flower size, especially hypanthium tube width, and nectar reward among C. concinna forms.Although C. breweri has adopted a novel hawkmoth pollination system, both ethological and mechanical floral isolation by hawkmoths are incomplete and vary according to the specific phenotype of the C. concinna source population. The results suggest that strong floral isolation is not automatically conferred by a pollinator shift and may require additional evolution of deterrent floral traits and habitat isolation that reduces the immediate spatial co-occurrence of young species.",

We used niche models to predict water availability as the major axis of ecological divergence and then tested that with a greenhouse experiment. Speciﬁcally, we manipulated water availability in ﬁeld soils for two populations of each species and predicted higher ﬁtness in conditions representing home habitats to those representing the environment of each's sister species.\nResults: Water availability and soil representing C. concinna generally increased both species' ﬁtness. Thus, water and soil may indeed limit C. concinna from colonizing the range of C. breweri, but not vice versa. We suggest that the competitive environment and pollinator availability, which are not directly captured with either approach, may be key biotic factors correlated with climate that contribute to unexplained ecogeographic isolation for C. breweri.\nConclusions: Ours is a valuable approach to assessing ecogeographic isolation, in that it balances feasibility with model validation, and our results have implications for species distribution modeling eﬀorts geared toward predicting climate change responses.",

We review existing methods and empirical studies to identify recent advances in the genomics of hybridization, as well as issues that need to be addressed. Notable progress has been made in the development of methods for detecting hybridization and inferring individual ancestries. However, few approaches reconstruct the magnitude and timing of gene flow, estimate the fitness of hybrids or incorporate knowledge of recombination rate. Empirical studies indicate that the genomic consequences of hybridization are complex, including a highly heterogeneous landscape of differentiation. Inferred characteristics of hybridization differ substantially among species groups. Loci showing unusual patterns – which may contribute to reproductive barriers – are usually scattered throughout the genome, with potential enrichment in sex chromosomes and regions of reduced recombination. We caution against the growing trend of interpreting genomic variation in summary statistics across genomes as evidence of differential gene flow. We argue that converting genomic patterns into useful inferences about hybridization will ultimately require models and methods that directly incorporate key ingredients of speciation, including the dynamic nature of gene flow, selection acting in hybrid populations and recombination rate variation.",

		"abstract": "The study of natural hybrid zones can illuminate aspects of lineage divergence and speciation in morphologically cryptic taxa. We studied a hybrid zone between two highly divergent but morphologically similar lineages (south-western and south-eastern) of the Iberian endemic Bosca's newt (Lissotriton boscai) in SW Iberia with a multilocus dataset (microsatellites, nuclear and mitochondrial genes). STRUCTURE and NEWHYBRIDS analyses retrieved few admixed individuals, which classified as backcrosses involving parental individuals of the south-western lineage. Our results show asymmetric introgression of mtDNA beyond the contact from this lineage into the south-eastern lineage. Analysis of nongeographic introgression patterns revealed asymmetries in the direction of introgression, but except for mtDNA, we did not find evidence for nonconcordant introgression patterns across nuclear loci. Analysis of a 150-km transect across the hybrid zone showed broadly coincident cline widths (ca. 3.2–27.9 km), and concordant cline centres across all markers, except for mtDNA that is displaced ca. 60 km northward. Results from ecological niche modelling show that the hybrid zone is in a climatically homogenous area with suitable habitat for the species, suggesting that contact between the two lineages is unlikely to occur further south as their distributions are currently separated by an extensive area of unfavourable habitat. Taken together, our findings suggest the genetic structure of this hybrid zone results from the interplay of historical (biogeographic) and population-level processes. The narrowness and coincidence of genetic clines can be explained by weak selection against hybrids and reflect a degree of reproductive isolation that is consistent with cryptic speciation.",

Using a genomic clines framework applied to 1,195 single nucleotide polymorphisms, we documented genomewide, locus-specific patterns of introgression between Choristoneura occidentalis biennis spruce budworms and two ecologically divergent relatives, C. o. occidentalis and Choristoneura fumiferana, that it interacts with at alternate boundaries of its range. We observe contrasting hybrid indexes between the two hybrid zones, no overlap in “gene-flow outliers” (clines showing relatively extreme extents or rates of locus-specific introgression) and variable linkage disequilibrium among those outliers. At the same time, correlated genomewide rates of introgression between zones suggest the presence of processes common to both boundaries. These findings highlight the contrasting population genetic dynamics that can occur at separate frontiers of a single population, while also suggesting that shared patterns may frequently accompany cases of divergence-with-gene-flow that involve a lineage in common. Our results point to potentially complex evolutionary outcomes for populations experiencing multiple sources of gene flow.",

		"abstract": "Hybrid zones have been promoted as windows on the evolutionary process and as laboratories for studying divergence and speciation. Patterns of divergence between hybridizing species can now be characterized on a genomewide scale, and recent genome scans have focused on the presence of ‘islands’ of divergence. Patterns of heterogeneous genomic divergence may reflect differential introgression following secondary contact and provide insights into which genome regions contribute to local adaptation, hybrid unfitness and positive assortative mating. However, heterogeneous genome divergence can also arise in the absence of any gene flow, as a result of variation in selection and recombination across the genome. We suggest that to understand hybrid zone origins and dynamics, it is essential to distinguish between genome regions that are divergent between pure parental populations and regions that show restricted introgression where these populations interact in hybrid zones. The latter, more so than the former, reveal the likely genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. Mosaic hybrid zones, because of their complex structure and multiple contacts, are particularly good subjects for distinguishing primary intergradation from secondary contact. Comparisons among independent hybrid zones or transects that involve the ‘same’ species pair can also help to distinguish between divergence with gene flow and secondary contact. However, data from replicate hybrid zones or replicate transects do not reveal consistent patterns; in a few cases, patterns of introgression are similar across independent transects, but for many taxa, there is distinct lack of concordance, presumably due to variation in environmental context and/or variation in the genetics of the interacting populations.",

		"abstract": "We propose a novel method that uses natural admixture between divergent lineages (hybridization) to investigate the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and adaptive introgression. Our method employs multinomial regression to estimate genomic clines and to quantify introgression for individual loci relative to the genomic background (clines in genotype frequency along a genomic admixture gradient). Loci with patterns of introgression that deviate significantly from null expectations based on the remainder of the genome are potentially subject to selection and thus of interest to understanding adaptation and the evolution of reproductive isolation. Using simulations, we show that different forms of selection modify these genomic clines in predictable ways and that our method has good power to detect moderate to strong selection for multiple forms of selection. Using individual-based simulations, we demonstrate that our method generally has a low false positive rate, except when genetic drift is particularly pronounced (e.g. low population size, low migration rates from parental populations, and substantial time since initial admixture). Additional individual-based simulations reveal that moderate selection against heterozygotes can be detected as much as 50 cm away from the focal locus directly experiencing selection, but is not detected at unlinked loci. Finally, we apply our analytical method to previously published data sets from a mouse (Mus musculus and M. domesticus) and two sunflower (Helianthus petiolaris and H. annuus) hybrid zones. This method should be applicable to numerous species that are currently the focus of research in evolution and ecology and should help bring about new insights regarding the processes underlying the origin and maintenance of biological diversity.",

		"abstract": "All genes interact with other genes, and their additive effects and epistatic interactions affect an organism's phenotype and fitness. Recent theoretical and empirical work has advanced our understanding of the role of multi-locus interactions in speciation. However, relating different models to one another and to empirical observations is challenging. This review focuses on multi-locus interactions that lead to reproductive isolation (RI) through reduced hybrid fitness. We first review theoretical approaches and show how recent work incorporating a mechanistic understanding of multi-locus interactions recapitulates earlier models, but also makes novel predictions concerning the build-up of RI. These include high variance in the build-up rate of RI among taxa, the emergence of strong incompatibilities producing localized barriers to introgression, and an effect of population size on the build-up of RI. We then review recent experimental approaches to detect multi-locus interactions underlying RI using genomic data. We argue that future studies would benefit from overlapping methods like ancestry disequilibrium scans, genome scans of differentiation and analyses of hybrid gene expression. Finally, we highlight a need for further overlap between theoretical and empirical work, and approaches that predict what kind of patterns multi-locus interactions resulting in incompatibilities will leave in genome-wide polymorphism data.\n            This article is part of the theme issue ‘Towards the completion of speciation: the evolution of reproductive isolation beyond the first barriers’.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization has many and varied impacts on the process of speciation. Hybridization may slow or reverse differentiation by allowing gene flow and recombination. It may accelerate speciation via adaptive introgression or cause near-instantaneous speciation by allopolyploidization. It may have multiple effects at different stages and in different spatial contexts within a single speciation event. We offer a perspective on the context and evolutionary significance of hybridization during speciation, highlighting issues of current interest and debate. In secondary contact zones, it is uncertain if barriers to gene flow will be strengthened or broken down due to recombination and gene flow. Theory and empirical evidence suggest the latter is more likely, except within and around strongly selected genomic regions. Hybridization may contribute to speciation through the formation of new hybrid taxa, whereas introgression of a few loci may promote adaptive divergence and so facilitate speciation. Gene regulatory networks, epigenetic effects and the evolution of selfish genetic material in the genome suggest that the Dobzhansky–Muller model of hybrid incompatibilities requires a broader interpretation. Finally, although the incidence of reinforcement remains uncertain, this and other interactions in areas of sympatry may have knock-on effects on speciation both within and outside regions of hybridization.",

If hybrids are less fit, the geographical range of ecologically divergent populations may be limited, and prezygotic reproductive isolation may be reinforced. If some hybrid genotypes are fitter than one or both parents, at least in some environments, then hybridization could make a positive contribution. Single alleles that are at an advantage in the alternative environment and genetic background will introgress readily, although such introgression may be hard to detect. ‘Hybrid speciation’, in which fit combinations of alleles are established, is more problematic; its likelihood depends on how divergent populations meet, and on the structure of epistasis. These issues are illustrated using Fisher’s model of stabilizing selection on multiple traits, under which reproductive isolation evolves as a side-effect of adaptation in allopatry. This confirms a priori arguments that while recombinant hybrids are less fit on average, some gene combinations may be fitter than the parents, even in the parental environment. Fisher’s model does predict heterosis in diploid F1s, asymmetric incompatibility in reciprocal backcrosses, and (when dominance is included) Haldane’s Rule. However, heterosis arises only when traits are additive, whereas the latter two patterns require dominance. Moreover, because adaptation is via substitutions of small effect, Fisher’s model does not generate the strong effects of single chromosome regions often observed in species crosses.",

When gene flow occurs during speciation, barriers restricting gene flow locally in the genome lead to patterns of heterogeneity. However, genomic heterogeneity can also be produced or modified by variation in factors such as background selection and selective sweeps, recombination and mutation rate variation, and heterogeneous gene density. Extracting the effects of gene flow, divergent selection and reproductive isolation from such modifying factors presents a major challenge to speciation genomics. We argue one of the principal aims of the field is to identify the barrier loci involved in limiting gene flow. We first summarize the expected signatures of selection at barrier loci, at the genomic regions linked to them and across the entire genome. We then discuss the modifying factors that complicate the interpretation of the observed genomic landscape. Finally, we end with a road map for future speciation research: a proposal for how to account for these modifying factors and to progress towards understanding the nature of barrier loci. Despite the difficulties of interpreting empirical data, we argue that the availability of promising technical and analytical methods will shed further light on the important roles that gene flow and divergent selection have in shaping the genomic landscape of speciation.",

		"abstract": "An important criterion for understanding speciation is the geographic context of population divergence. Three major modes of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric speciation define the extent of spatial overlap and gene flow between diverging populations. However, mixed modes of speciation are also possible, whereby populations experience periods of allopatry, parapatry, and/or sympatry at different times as they diverge. Here, we report clinal patterns of variation for 21 nuclear-encoded microsatellites and a wing spot phenotype for cherry-infesting Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) across North America consistent with these flies having initially diverged in parapatry followed by a period of allopatric differentiation in the early Holocene. However, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) displays a different pattern; cherry flies at the ends of the clines in the eastern USA and Pacific Northwest share identical haplotypes, while centrally located populations in the southwestern USA and Mexico possess a different haplotype. We hypothesize that the mitochondrial difference could be due to lineage sorting but more likely reflects a selective sweep of a favorable mtDNA variant or the spread of an endosymbiont. The estimated divergence time for mtDNA suggests possible past allopatry, secondary contact, and subsequent isolation between USA and Mexican fly populations initiated before the Wisconsin glaciation. Thus, the current genetics of cherry flies may involve different mixed modes of divergence occurring in different portions of the fly's range. We discuss the need for additional DNA sequencing and quantification of prezygotic and postzygotic reproductive isolation to verify the multiple mixed-mode hypothesis for cherry flies and draw parallels from other systems to assess the generality that speciation may commonly involve complex biogeographies of varying combinations of allopatric, parapatric, and sympatric divergence.",

		"abstract": "There has been much recent excitement about the use of genetics to elucidate ancestral history and demography. Whole genome data from humans and other species are revealing complex stories of divergence and admixture that were left undiscovered by previous smaller data sets. A central challenge is to estimate the timing of past admixture and divergence events, for example the time at which Neanderthals exchanged genetic material with humans and the time at which modern humans left Africa. Here, we present a method for using sequence data to jointly estimate the timing and magnitude of past admixture events, along with population divergence times and changes in effective population size. We infer demography from a collection of pairwise sequence alignments by summarizing their length distribution of tracts of identity by state (IBS) and maximizing an analytic composite likelihood derived from a Markovian coalescent approximation. Recent gene flow between populations leaves behind long tracts of identity by descent (IBD), and these tracts give our method power by influencing the distribution of shared IBS tracts. In simulated data, we accurately infer the timing and strength of admixture events, population size changes, and divergence times over a variety of ancient and recent time scales. Using the same technique, we analyze deeply sequenced trio parents from the 1000 Genomes project. The data show evidence of extensive gene flow between Africa and Europe after the time of divergence as well as substructure and gene flow among ancestral hominids. In particular, we infer that recent African-European gene flow and ancient ghost admixture into Europe are both necessary to explain the spectrum of IBS sharing in the trios, rejecting simpler models that contain less population structure.",

		"abstract": "Understanding factors regulating hybrid fitness and gene exchange is a major research challenge for evolutionary biology. Genomic cline analysis has been used to evaluate alternative patterns of introgression, but only two models have been used widely and the approach has generally lacked a hypothesis testing framework for distinguishing effects of selection and drift. I propose two alternative cline models, implement multivariate outlier detection to identify markers associated with hybrid fitness, and simulate hybrid zone dynamics to evaluate the signatures of different modes of selection. Analysis of simulated data shows that previous approaches are prone to false positives (multinomial regression) or relatively insensitive to outlier loci affected by selection (Barton's concordance). The new, theory-based logit-logistic cline model is generally best at detecting loci affecting hybrid fitness. Although some generalizations can be made about different modes of selection, there is no one-to-one correspondence between pattern and process. These new methods will enhance our ability to extract important information about the genetics of reproductive isolation and hybrid fitness. However, much remains to be done to relate statistical patterns to particular evolutionary processes. The methods described here are implemented in a freely available package “HIest” for the R statistical software (CRAN; http://cran.r-project.org/).",

		"abstract": "We developed a Bayesian genomic cline model to study the genetic architecture of adaptive divergence and reproductive isolation between hybridizing lineages. This model quantifies locus-specific patterns of introgression with two cline parameters that describe the probability of locus-specific ancestry as a function of genome-wide admixture. ‘Outlier’ loci with extreme patterns of introgression relative to most of the genome can be identified. These loci are potentially associated with adaptive divergence or reproductive isolation. We simulated genetic data for admixed populations that included neutral introgression, as well as loci that were subject to directional, epistatic or underdominant selection, and analysed these data using the Bayesian genomic cline model. Under many demographic conditions, underdominance or directional selection had detectable and predictable effects on cline parameters, and ‘outlier’ loci were greatly enriched for genetic regions affected by selection. We also analysed previously published genetic data from two transects through a hybrid zone between Mus domesticus and M. musculus. We found considerable variation in rates of introgression across the genome and particularly low rates of introgression for two X-linked markers. There were similarities and differences in patterns of introgression between the two transects, which likely reflects a combination of stochastic variability because of genetic drift and geographic variation in the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation. By providing a robust framework to quantify and compare patterns of introgression among genetic regions and populations, the Bayesian genomic cline model will advance our understanding of the genetics of reproductive isolation and the speciation process.",

		"abstract": "Background:  Patterns of multi-locus differentiation (i.e., genomic clines) often extend broadly across hybrid zones and their quantification can help diagnose how species boundaries are shaped by adaptive processes, both intrinsic and extrinsic. In this sense, the transitioning of loci across admixed individuals can be contrasted as a function of the genome-wide trend, in turn allowing an expansion of clinal theory across a much wider array of biodiversity. However, computational tools that serve to interpret and consequently visualize ‘genomic clines’ are limited, and users must often write custom, relatively complex code to do so.\nResults:  Here, we introduce the ClineHelpR R-package for visualizing genomic clines and detecting outlier loci using output generated by two popular software packages, bgc and Introgress. ClineHelpR bundles both input generation (i.e., filtering datasets and creating specialized file formats) and output processing (e.g., MCMC thinning and burn-in) with functions that directly facilitate interpretation and hypothesis testing. Tools are also provided for post-hoc analyses that interface with external packages such as ENMeval and RIdeogram.\nConclusions:  Our package increases the reproducibility and accessibility of genomic cline methods, thus allowing an expanded user base and promoting these methods as mechanisms to address diverse evolutionary questions in both model and non-model organisms. Furthermore, the ClineHelpR extended functionality can evaluate genomic clines in the context of spatial and environmental features, allowing users to explore underlying processes potentially contributing to the observed patterns and helping facilitate effective conservation management strategies.",

Introgression was detected only at the margins of the species’ distribution. IBD was significant across the sampled area as a whole, but no evidence of restricted gene flow was detected in a core of drainages from southern British Columbia (BC). We identified a large number of FST outliers. Gene Ontology analyses revealed that FST outliers are overrepresented in genes involved in circadian rhythm and response to red/far-red light when the entire dataset is considered, whereas in southern BC heat response genes are overrepresented. We also identified strong correlations between geoclimate variables and allele frequencies at FST outlier loci that provide clues regarding the selective pressures acting at these loci.",

		"abstract": "An increasing number of studies are using landscape genomics to investigate local adaptation in wild and domestic populations. Implementation of this approach requires the sampling phase to consider the complexity of environmental settings and the burden of logistical constraints. These important aspects are often underestimated in the literature dedicated to sampling strategies. In this study, we computed simulated genomic data sets to run against actual environmental data in order to trial landscape genomics experiments under distinct sampling strategies. These strategies differed by design approach (to enhance environmental and/or geographical representativeness at study sites), number of sampling locations and sample sizes. We then evaluated how these elements affected statistical performances (power and false discoveries) under two antithetical demographic scenarios. Our results highlight the importance of selecting an appropriate sample size, which should be modified based on the demographic characteristics of the studied population. For species with limited dispersal, sample sizes above 200 units are generally sufficient to detect most adaptive signals, while in random mating populations this threshold should be increased to 400 units. Furthermore, we describe a design approach that maximizes both environmental and geographical representativeness of sampling sites and show how it systematically outperforms random or regular sampling schemes. Finally, we show that although having more sampling locations (between 40 and 50 sites) increase statistical power and reduce false discovery rate, similar results can be achieved with a moderate number of sites (20 sites). Overall, this study provides valuable guidelines for optimizing sampling strategies for landscape genomics experiments.",

		"abstract": "Recently, techniques available for identifying clusters of individuals or boundaries between clusters using genetic data from natural populations have expanded rapidly. Consequently, there is a need to evaluate these different techniques. We used spatially-explicit simulation models to compare three spatial Bayesian clustering programs and two edge detection methods. Spatially-structured populations were simulated where a continuous population was subdivided by barriers. We evaluated the ability of each method to correctly identify boundary locations while varying: (i) time after divergence, (ii) strength of isolation by distance, (iii) level of genetic diversity, and (iv) amount of gene flow across barriers. To further evaluate the methods’ effectiveness to detect genetic clusters in natural populations, we used previously published data on North American pumas and a European shrub. Our results show that with simulated and empirical data, the Bayesian spatial clustering algorithms outperformed direct edge detection methods. All methods incorrectly detected boundaries in the presence of strong patterns of isolation by distance. Based on this finding, we support the application of Bayesian spatial clustering algorithms for boundary detection in empirical datasets, with necessary tests for the influence of isolation by distance.",

		"abstract": "There has been much recent excitement about the use of genetics to elucidate ancestral history and demography. Whole genome data from humans and other species are revealing complex stories of divergence and admixture that were left undiscovered by previous smaller data sets. A central challenge is to estimate the timing of past admixture and divergence events, for example the time at which Neanderthals exchanged genetic material with humans and the time at which modern humans left Africa. Here, we present a method for using sequence data to jointly estimate the timing and magnitude of past admixture events, along with population divergence times and changes in effective population size. We infer demography from a collection of pairwise sequence alignments by summarizing their length distribution of tracts of identity by state (IBS) and maximizing an analytic composite likelihood derived from a Markovian coalescent approximation. Recent gene flow between populations leaves behind long tracts of identity by descent (IBD), and these tracts give our method power by influencing the distribution of shared IBS tracts. In simulated data, we accurately infer the timing and strength of admixture events, population size changes, and divergence times over a variety of ancient and recent time scales. Using the same technique, we analyze deeply sequenced trio parents from the 1000 Genomes project. The data show evidence of extensive gene flow between Africa and Europe after the time of divergence as well as substructure and gene flow among ancestral hominids. In particular, we infer that recent African-European gene flow and ancient ghost admixture into Europe are both necessary to explain the spectrum of IBS sharing in the trios, rejecting simpler models that contain less population structure.",

		"abstract": "Comparing allele frequencies among populations that differ in environment has long been a tool for detecting loci involved in local adaptation. However, such analyses are complicated by an imperfect knowledge of population allele frequencies and neutral correlations of allele frequencies among populations due to shared population history and gene ﬂow. Here we develop a set of methods to robustly test for unusual allele frequency patterns and correlations between environmental variables and allele frequencies while accounting for these complications based on a Bayesian model previously implemented in the software Bayenv. Using this model, we calculate a set of “standardized allele frequencies” that allows investigators to apply tests of their choice to multiple populations while accounting for sampling and covariance due to population history. We illustrate this ﬁrst by showing that these standardized frequencies can be used to detect nonparametric correlations with environmental variables; these correlations are also less prone to spurious results due to outlier populations. We then demonstrate how these standardized allele frequencies can be used to construct a test to detect SNPs that deviate strongly from neutral population structure. This test is conceptually related to FST and is shown to be more powerful, as we account for population history. We also extend the model to next-generation sequencing of population pools—a cost-efﬁcient way to estimate population allele frequencies, but one that introduces an additional level of sampling noise. The utility of these methods is demonstrated in simulations and by reanalyzing human SNP data from the Human Genome Diversity Panel populations and pooled next-generation sequencing data from Atlantic herring. An implementation of our method is available from http://gcbias.org.",

		"abstract": "Widely distributed species are normally subjected to spatial heterogeneity in environmental conditions. In sessile organisms like plants, adaptive evolution and phenotypic plasticity of key functional traits are the main mechanisms through which species can respond to environmental heterogeneity and climate change. While extended research has been carried out in temperate species in this regard, there is still limited knowledge as to how species from seasonally-dry tropical climates respond to spatial and temporal variation in environmental conditions. In fact, studies of intraspecific genetically-based differences in functional traits are still largely unknown and studies in these ecosystems have largely focused on in situ comparisons where environmental and genetic effects cannot be differentiated. In this study, we tested for ecotypic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity in leaf economics spectrum (LES) traits, water use efficiency and growth rates under natural and manipulated precipitation regimes in a common garden experiment where seedlings of eight populations of the neotropical live oak Quercus oleoides were established. We also examined the extent to which intraspecific trait variation was associated with plant performance under different water availability. Similar to interspecific patterns among seasonally-dry tropical tree species, live oak populations with long and severe dry seasons had higher leaf nitrogen content and growth rates than mesic populations, which is consistent with a “fast” resource-acquisition strategy aimed to maximize carbon uptake during the wet season. Specific leaf area (SLA) was the best predictor of plant performance, but contrary to expectations, it was negatively associated with relative and absolute growth rates. This observation was partially explained by the negative association between SLA and area-based photosynthetic rates, which is contrary to LES expectations but similar to other recent intraspecific studies on evergreen oaks. Overall, our study shows strong intraspecific differences in functional traits in a tropical oak, Quercus oleoides, and suggests that precipitation regime has played an important role in driving adaptive divergence in this widespread species.",

This study demonstrates the potential for rapid, continuous evolution to changing environmental conditions and highlights the importance of collecting data with a high temporal resolution for observing the effects of fluctuating selection. —BEL\n            \n          , \n            Fruit flies show continuous adaptation to environmental changes from summer to autumn in the field.\n          , \n            \n              INTRODUCTION\n              Adaptation is a foundational process in evolutionary biology that is central to human health and the conservation of biodiversity. Adaptive tracking, defined as continuous adaptation in response to rapid environmental change, is a potentially critical mechanism by which populations persist in changing environments. However, little is known about the pace, extent, and magnitude of adaptive tracking in response to natural temporal variation. This may be attributable to the historical perception that adaptation occurs slowly relative to environmental change as well as to difficulties in measurement. Replicated field experiments that directly measure phenotypic and genomic evolution in response to ongoing environmental change could provide the resolution necessary to answer fundamental questions about the process of adaptation, including those about adaptive tracking. If adaptive tracking does occur in populations experiencing rapid environmental change, it would alter our understanding of the importance of evolutionary change for ecological outcomes.\n            \n            \n              RATIONALE\n              \n                The design of our field experiment focused on three key elements to study adaptive tracking in response to ongoing environmental change: (i) generating highly accurate measurements of phenotypic and genomic evolution, (ii) taking these measurements on a time scale similar to that of natural environmental change, and (iii) collecting measurements from independent replicate populations experiencing similar environmental conditions. Specifically, we directly measured phenotypic and genomic evolution in response to natural seasonal change across 10 independent replicate field populations, each comprising up to 100,000\n                Drosophila melanogaster\n                individuals. We measured the evolution of heritable phenotypes related to stress tolerance and reproductive output under typical laboratory conditions (repeated common-garden rearing) over monthly intervals from July to November 2014. Individuals collected at the same intervals from each population were used for full-genome pooled sequencing to measure genomic change over time. We specifically assessed the degree of parallel phenotypic and genomic change across replicate populations, as any parallelism would be strong evidence of the deterministic evolutionary process of adaptation. We further looked for reversals in the direction of adaptation over time, which would demonstrate variation in the direction of natural selection (termed fluctuating selection) and would provide strong evidence for adaptive tracking.\n              \n            \n            \n              RESULTS\n              We assayed phenotypic evolution of six fitness-associated phenotypes and genomic evolution at 1.9 million single-nucleotide polymorphic sites across the genome. We found clear evidence of parallel phenotypic and genomic evolution indicative of adaptive tracking. Phenotypic adaptation was pervasive and remarkably fast relative to measures of trait change from many prior studies. Moreover, the direction of evolution changed over time for development rate (a key component of reproductive output) and desiccation tolerance (an important trait in stress resistance). Similar patterns were observed in genomic data, with clear signatures of parallel allele frequency change across time intervals, including some that resulted from fluctuating selection. Genomic regions implicated in selection were found on all chromosomes, yet most were under selection over only a single time interval. At least 165 independent genomic regions were under selection during the experiment; allele frequencies at >60% of variant sites genome-wide were shaped in part by selection. Taken together, these data underscore that natural selection is capable of driving evolution in multiple fitness-associated phenotypes and much of the genome even over short time scales.\n            \n            \n              CONCLUSION\n              Our experiment shows the feasibility of observing adaptive tracking in response to environmental change in real time using replicated field experiments. Our data from this approach support a model of adaptive tracking in which populations adapt in response to continuous environmental change, with selection acting on multiple phenotypes and tens to hundreds of genetic variants. The pronounced action of fluctuating selection suggests that evolutionary rates may be systematically underestimated and that fluctuating selection could be an underappreciated mechanism that maintains diversity. Determining whether adaptive tracking is a general feature of natural populations, and elucidating the mechanisms by which it occurs, could be transformative for understanding the generation and maintenance of biodiversity.\n              \n                \n                  Adaptation tracks ongoing environmental change.\n                  \n                    We conducted a replicated longitudinal field experiment using outbred\n                    Drosophila\n                    populations to assess the phenotypic and genomic basis of adaptation in response to natural seasonal environmental change. We observed fast phenotypic adaptation in multiple phenotypes, parallel change in allele frequencies at dozens of independent loci, and reversals in the direction of adaptative evolution for some traits and loci over monthly time intervals.",

We quantified the relationships between wood density, anatomy, and climate in 61 shrub species from eight field sites along latitudinal belts between 31° and 35° in North and South America. Measurements included cell dimensions, transverse areas of each xylem cell type and percentage contact between different cell types and vessels. Wood density was more significantly correlated with precipitation and aridity than with temperature. High wood density was achieved through reductions in cell size and increases in the proportion of wall relative to lumen. Wood density was independent of vessel traits, suggesting that this trait does not impose conduction limitations in shrubs. The proportion of fibers in direct contact with vessels decreased with and was independent of wood density, indicating that the number of fiber-vessel contacts does not explain the previously observed correlation between wood density and implosion resistance. Axial and radial parenchyma each had a significant but opposite association with wood density. Fiber size and wall thickness link wood density, life history, and ecological strategies by controlling the proportion of carbon invested per unit stem volume.",

		"abstract": "ABSTRACT\n          The field of population genomics has grown rapidly in response to the recent advent of affordable, large-scale sequencing technologies. As opposed to the situation during the majority of the 20th century, in which the development of theoretical and statistical population-genetic insights out-paced the generation of data to which they could be applied, genomic data are now being produced at a far greater rate than they can be meaningfully analyzed and interpreted. With this wealth of data has come a tendency to focus on fitting specific (and often rather idiosyncratic) models to data, at the expense of a careful exploration of the range of possible underlying evolutionary processes. For example, the approach of directly investigating models of adaptive evolution in each newly sequenced population or species often neglects the fact that a thorough characterization of ubiquitous non-adaptive processes is a prerequisite for accurate inference. We here describe the perils of these tendencies, present our consensus views on current best practices in population genomic data analysis, and highlight areas of statistical inference and theory that are in need of further attention. Thereby, we argue for the importance of defining a biologically relevant baseline model tuned to the details of each new analysis, of skepticism and scrutiny in interpreting model-fitting results, and of carefully defining addressable hypotheses and underlying uncertainties.",

		"abstract": "A central principle in trait-based ecology is that trait variation has an adaptive value. However, uncertainty over which plant traits influence individual performance across environmental gradients may limit our ability to use traits to infer ecological processes at larger scales. To better understand which traits are linked to performance under different precipitation regimes, we measured above- and belowground traits, growth, and reproductive allocation for four annual and four perennial species from a coastal sage scrub community in California under conditions of 50%, 100%, and 150% ambient precipitation. Across water treatments, annual species displayed morphological trait values consistent with high rates of resource acquisition (e.g., low leaf mass per area, low root tissue density, high specific root length), and aboveground measures of resource acquisition (including photosynthetic rate and leaf N concentration) were positively associated with plant performance (reproductive allocation). Results from a structural equation model demonstrated that leaf traits explained 38% of the variation in reproductive allocation across the water gradient in annual species, while root traits accounted for only 6%. Although roots play a critical role in water uptake, more work is needed to understand the mechanisms by which root trait variation can influence performance in water-limited environments. Perennial species showed lower trait plasticity than annuals across the water gradient and were more variable as a group in terms of trait–performance relationships, indicating that species rely on different functional strategies to respond to drought. Our finding that species identity drives much of the variation in trait values and trait–performance relationships across a water gradient may simplify efforts to model ecological processes, such as productivity, that are potentially influenced by environmentally induced shifts in trait values.",

		"abstract": "Root trait variation and plasticity could be key factors differentiating plant performance under drought. However, water manipulation and root measurements are rarely coupled empirically across growth forms to identify whether belowground strategies are generalizable across species. We measured seedling root traits across three moisture levels in 18 Mediterranean forbs, grasses, and woody species. Drought increased the root mass fraction (RMF) and decreased the relative proportion of thin roots (indicated by increased root diameters and decreased specific root length (SRL)), rates of root elongation and growth, plant nitrogen uptake, and plant growth. Although responses varied across species, plasticity was not associated with growth form. Woody species differed from forbs and grasses in many traits, but herbaceous groups were similar. Across water treatments, trait correlations suggested a single spectrum of belowground trade-offs related to resource acquisition and plant growth. While effects of SRL and RMF on plant growth shifted with drought, root elongation rate consistently represented this spectrum. We demonstrate that general patterns of root morphology and plasticity are identifiable across diverse species. Root trait measurements should enhance our understanding of belowground strategy and performance across growth forms, but it will be critical to incorporate plasticity and additional aspects of root function into these efforts.",

		"abstract": "1 Large-seeded species have long been known to have higher survivorship during establishment than small-seeded species. Here, we assessed the size of this advantage by compiling published data on survival through seedling emergence, seedling establishment and sapling establishment. 2 We found no relationship between seed mass and survival through the transition from viable seed in or on the soil to newly emerged seedlings (P = 0.47, n = 33 species). 3 Synthesis of data from experimental studies on the advantages of large-seeded species establishing under particular hazards (such as shade, drought or herbivory) confirmed that seedlings of large-seeded species perform better than those of small-seeded species in most situations. However, the magnitude of this advantage was not sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m−2 of canopy outline year−1. 4 Synthesis of data from field studies of populations under natural conditions also showed that large-seeded species have higher survival through early seedling establishment than small-seeded species (P = 0.006, n = 112 species). However, the magnitude of this advantage would only be sufficient to counterbalance the greater number of seeds produced by small-seeded species m−2 of canopy outline year−1 if mortality continued at the same rate for some time. 5 The time required for a species with 10-fold larger seeds to recoup the advantage gained by a smaller-seeded species during seed production ranged from 8.8 weeks for the smallest seeded species in the data set, up to an implausible 4.2 years for the largest-seeded species. Thus, while large-seeded species do have a survival advantage over small-seeded species during seedling establishment, the available evidence suggests that advantages must also accrue during other stages in the life cycle. One possibility is that the greater seed production of small-seeded species (m−2 of canopy outline year−1) is partly offset by larger canopies and longer reproductive life spans in large-seeded species.",

		"abstract": "There is growing recognition that classifying terrestrial plant species on the basis of their function (into ‘functional types’) rather than their higher taxonomic identity, is a promising way forward for tackling important ecological questions at the scale of ecosystems, landscapes or biomes. These questions include those on vegetation responses to and vegetation effects on, environmental changes (e.g. changes in climate, atmospheric chemistry, land use or other disturbances). There is also growing consensus about a shortlist of plant traits that should underlie such functional plant classifications, because they have strong predictive power of important ecosystem responses to environmental change and/or they themselves have strong impacts on ecosystem processes. The most favoured traits are those that are also relatively easy and inexpensive to measure for large numbers of plant species. Large international research efforts, promoted by the IGBP–GCTE Programme, are underway to screen predominant plant species in various ecosystems and biomes worldwide for such traits. This paper provides an international methodological protocol aimed at standardising this research effort, based on consensus among a broad group of scientists in this field. It features a practical handbook with step-by-step recipes, with relatively brief information about the ecological context, for 28 functional traits recognised as critical for tackling large-scale ecological questions.",

		"abstract": "We commonly use trait variation to characterize plant function within and among species and understand how vegetation responds to the environment. Seedling emergence is an especially vulnerable window affecting population and community dynamics, yet trait-based frameworks often bypass this earliest stage of plant life. Here we assess whether traits vary in ecologically meaningful ways when seedlings are just days old. How do shared evolutionary history and environmental conditions shape trait expression, and can traits explain which seedlings endure drought? We measured seedling traits in the first 4 days of life for 16 annual plant species under two water treatments, exploring trait trade-offs, species-level plasticity and the ability of traits to predict duration of survival under drought. Nearly half of traits showed the imprint of evolutionary history (i.e. significant phylogenetic signal), often reflecting differences between grasses and forbs, two groups separated by a deep evolutionary split. Water availability altered trait expression in most cases, though species-level plastic responses also reflected evolutionary history. On average, new seedlings exhibited substantial trait variation structured as multiple trade-offs like those found in mature plants. Some species invested in thick roots and shoots, whereas others invested in more efficient tissues. Separately, some invested in tougher roots and others in deeper roots. We also observed trade-offs related to growth rates (fast or slow) and biomass allocation (above- or below-ground). Drought survival time was correlated most strongly with seed mass, root construction and allocation traits, and phylogeny (grasses vs. forbs). Synthesis. Our results show that seed and seedling trait variation among annual species is substantial, and that a few attributes could capture major dimensions of ecological strategies during emergence. With seedling survival times ranging twofold among annuals (from 7.5 to 14.5 days), these strategies could mitigate recruitment responses to more frequent or longer dry spells. Multivariate trait and plasticity strategies should be further explored in studies designed to assess trait-fitness linkages during recruitment.

Results showed that the predominant ecological strategies of species in the tropical rainforest were CS-selected, and the predominant categories in the evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forest and warm-temperate coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest were CSR and S/CSR categories respectively, whereas those in the cold-temperate coniferous forest were the S-selected ones.

The categories of ecological strategies with more component S increased while those with more component C decreased with the change of typical forest vegetation types from tropical rainforest through evergreen-deciduous broadleaved mixed forest and warm-temperate coniferous-broadleaved mixed forest to cool-temperate coniferous forest.

		"abstract": "Previous studies have indicated that a niche variation scheme, similar to the periodic table of elements, can be constructed based on functional traits. The periodic table of niches for species is defined as a multidimensional ordination scheme of niche relationships and their orders in a specific biotic community. Comparing functional trait-based niches is extremely useful in theoretical studies of plant ecological strategies, community assembly, and the geographic differentiation of biomes across different climatic zones. Here, data for 11 functional traits belonging to three fundamental niche dimensions (leaf economy, mechanical support, and reproductive phenology) were compiled for 215 woody species from forests across four climatic zones (tropical, subtropical, warm-temperate, and cold-temperate). We constructed the periodic table of niches based on the functional traits of plants in different communities and explored their variations among biomes. A principal component analysis (PCA) was performed to derive the dominant gradients of trait combinations for each individual niche dimensional dataset. Then species scores for the first two axes (PC1 and PC2) were used as inputs for a second PCA to ordinate species in the continuous niche space constrained by the three niche dimensions. Changes in the functional niches of plants from the four biomes along the PC1 and PC2 of niche space were examined based on species scores. Leaf economy was the dominant functional dimension in the plant niche space, followed by mechanical support. Considerable niche convergences among different species were found in the niche space for each biome, except cold-temperate forest. The species niches varied mainly with the increasing specific leaf area/decreasing stem tissue density along PC1, and with the decrease of leaf area/plant size along PC2 from tropical to temperate forests, suggesting that the ecological strategies of plants in the four biomes changed from conservative to acquisitive with an increase in latitude. Our results confirmed that the periodic table of niches does exist and can be constructed by major functional dimensions composed of dominant functional traits. The periodic table of niches effectively reflects the changes of ecological strategies of plant species in biomes across different climatic zones.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization between lineages that have not reached complete reproductive isolation appears more and more like a common phenomenon. Indeed, speciation genomics studies have now extensively shown that many species’ genomes have hybrid ancestry. However, genomic patterns of introgression are often heterogeneous across the genome. In many organisms, a positive correlation between introgression levels and recombination rate has been observed. It is usually explained by the purging of deleterious introgressed material due to incompatibilities. However, the opposite relationship was observed in a North American population of Drosophila melanogaster with admixed European and African ancestry. In order to explore how directional and epistatic selection can impact the relationship between introgression and recombination, we performed forward simulations of whole D. melanogaster genomes reflecting the North American population’s history. Our results revealed that the simplest models of positive selection often yield negative correlations between introgression and recombination such as the one observed in D. melanogaster. We also confirmed that incompatibilities tend to produce positive introgression-recombination correlations. And yet, we identify parameter space under each model where the predicted correlation is reversed. These findings deepen our understanding of the evolutionary forces that may shape patterns of ancestry across genomes, and they strengthen the foundation for future studies aimed at estimating genome-wide parameters of selection in admixed populations.",

		"abstract": "The lifetime fitnesses of individuals comprising a population determine its numerical dynamics, and genetic variation in fitness results in evolutionary change. This dual importance of individual fitness is well understood, but empirical fitness records generally violate the assumptions of standard statistical approaches. This problem has undermined comprehensive study of fitness and impeded empirical synthesis of the numerical and genetic dynamics of populations. Recently developed aster models remedy this problem by explicitly modeling the dependence of later-expressed components of fitness (e.g., fecundity) on those expressed earlier (e.g., survival to reproduce). Moreover, aster models employ different sampling distributions for different components of fitness (e.g., binomial for survival over a given interval and Poisson for fecundity). Analysis is done by maximum likelihood, and the resulting distributions for lifetime fitness closely approximate observed data. We illustrate the breadth of aster models' utility with three examples demonstrating estimation of the finite rate of increase, comparison of mean fitness among genotypic groups, and analysis of phenotypic selection. Aster models offer a unified approach to addressing the breadth of questions in evolution and ecology for which life-history data are gathered.",

		"abstract": "Abstract\n          \n            The ability of plants to track shifting fitness optima is crucial within the context of global change, where increasing environmental extremes may have dramatic consequences to life history, fitness, and ultimately species persistence. However, to track changing conditions relies upon the complex relationship between genetic and environmental variance, where selection may favor plasticity, the evolution of genetic differences, or both depending on the spatial and temporal scale of environmental heterogeneity. Over three years, we compared the genetic and environmental components of phenological and life-history variation in a common environment for the spring perennial\n            Geum triflorum\n            . Populations were sourced from alvar habitats that exhibit extreme, but predictable annual flood-desiccation cycles and prairie habitats that exhibit similar, but less predictable variation in water availability. Narrow-sense heritabilities were generally higher for early life history (emergence probability) relative to later life history traits (total seed mass), indicating that traits associated with establishment within an environment are under stronger genetic control relative to later life-history fitness expressions, where plasticity may play a larger role. This pattern was particularly notable in seeds sourced from environmentally extreme, but predictable alvar habitats relative to less predictable prairie seed sources. Fitness landscapes based on seed source origin, largely characterized by varying water availability and flower production, described selection as the degree of maladaptation to the prairie common garden environment relative to seed source environment. Plants from alvar populations were consistently closer to the fitness optimum across all years. Annually, the breadth of the fitness optimum expanded primarily along a moisture gradient, with inclusion of more populations onto the expanding optimum. These results highlight the importance of temporally and spatially varying selection for the evolution of life history, indicating plasticity within perennial systems may over time become the primary mechanism to track fitness for later life history events.",

		"abstract": "Drought-related selection during seedling emergence and early development may play a strong role in adaptation. Yet this process is poorly understood and particularly so in relation to ongoing climate change. To evaluate drought-induced differences in selection during early life stages, a total of 50 maternal families sampled from three climatically disparate ponderosa pine (Pinus ponderosa Doug.) populations were grown from seed in two common garden field experiments at a location that was warmer and drier than seed origins. Three drought treatments were imposed experimentally. Phenotypic selection was assessed by relating plant fitness measured as survival or unconditional expected height at age 3 to seed density (mass per unit volume), date of emergence, and timing of shoot elongation. In the year of emergence from seed, differential mortality was particularly strong and clearly indicated selection. In contrast, selection in subsequent years was far less pronounced. Phenotypes with high seed density, an intermediate but relatively early emergence date, and high 2nd-year early-season shoot elongation exhibited the greatest estimated fitness under drought. The form of selection varied among seed sources in relation to drought treatment. Selection was generally more acute in the cases of greatest difference between drought treatment and climatic patterns of precipitation at the site of seed origin. These results suggest that populations of ponderosa pine are differentially adapted to drought patterns associated with the climate of their origin. To the extent that the phenotypic traits examined are heritable or correlated with heritable traits, our results provide insight into how tree populations may evolve in response to drought.",

		"abstract": "Growth rhythm that is well synchronized with seasonal changes in local climatic conditions is understood to enhance fitness; however, rapid ongoing climate change threatens to disrupt this synchrony. To evaluate phenotypic selection on growth rhythm under expected warmer and drier future climate, seedlings from 49 populations of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis Engelm.) were grown and measured over more than 10 years in two common garden field experiments on sites that approximate the projected future climate of the seed origins. Selection on growth rhythm was assessed by relating individual plant fitness to timing and rate of shoot elongation. Differential survival clearly evidenced selection on growth rhythm. We detected directional and stabilizing selection that varied in magnitude between experimental sites and among years. The observed phenotypic selection supports the interpretation of clinal variation among populations within tree species as reflecting adaptive variation in response to past natural selection mediated by climate. To the extent that growth rhythm is heritable, results of the present study suggest evolution of whitebark pine toward a more distinct timing of shoot elongation and generally more rapid elongation in the immediate next generation under ongoing climate change in environments similar to the study sites.",

We illustrate their utility with an analysis of data taken from an experimental study of Echinacea angustifolia sampled from remnant prairie populations in western Minnesota. These models generalize both generalized linear models and survival analysis. The joint distribution is factorized as a product of conditional distributions, each an exponential family with the conditioning variable being the sample size of the conditional distribution. The model may be heterogeneous, each conditional distribution being from a different exponential family. We show that the joint distribution is from a flat exponential family and derive its canonical parameters, Fisher information and other properties. These models are implemented in an R package ‘aster’ available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network, CRAN.",

In ANOVA terminology, it is the testing for treatment effects with an error term inappropriate to the hypothesis being considered. Scrutiny of 176 experimental studies published between 1960 and the present revealed that pseudoreplication occurred in 27% of them, or 48% of all such studies that applied inferential statistics. The incidence of pseudoreplication is especially high in studies of marine benthos and small mammals. The critical features of controlled experimentation are reviewed. Nondemonic intrusion is defined as the impingement of chance events on an experiment in progress. As a safeguard against both it and preexisting gradients, interspersion of treatments is argued to be an obligatory feature of good design. Especially in small experiments, adequate interspersion can sometimes be assured only by dispensing with strict randomization procedures. Comprehension of this conflict between interspersion and randomization is aided by distinguishing pre-layout (or conventional) and layout-specific alpha (probability of type I error). Suggestions are offered to statisticians and editors of ecological journals as to how ecologists' understanding of experimental design and statistics might be improved.",

Efforts to understand the links between evolutionary and ecological dynamics hinge on our ability to measure and understand how genes influence phenotypes, fitness and population dynamics. Quantitative genetics provides a range of theoretical and empirical tools with which to achieve this when the relatedness between individuals within a population is known. 2. A number of recent studies have used a type of mixed-effects model, known as the animal model, to estimate the genetic component of phenotypic variation using data collected in the field. Here, we provide a practical guide for ecologists interested in exploring the potential to apply this quantitative genetic method in their research. 3. We begin by outlining, in simple terms, key concepts in quantitative genetics and how an animal model estimates relevant quantitative genetic parameters, such as heritabilities or genetic correlations. 4. We then provide three detailed example tutorials, for implementation in a variety of software packages, for some basic applications of the animal model. We discuss several important statistical issues relating to best practice when fitting different kinds of mixed models. 5. We conclude by briefly summarizing more complex applications of the animal model, and by highlighting key pitfalls and dangers for the researcher wanting to begin using quantitative genetic tools to address ecological and evolutionary questions.",

		"abstract": "Speciation is the process by which barriers to gene flow evolve between populations. Although we now know that speciation is largely driven by natural selection, knowledge of the agents of selection and the genetic and genomic mechanisms that facilitate divergence is required for a satisfactory theory of speciation. In this essay, we highlight three advances/problems in our understanding of speciation that have arisen from studies of the genes and genomic regions that underlie the evolution of reproductive isolation. First, we describe how the identification of “speciation” genes makes it possible to identify the agents of selection causing the evolution of reproductive isolation, while also noting that the link between the genetics of phenotypic divergence and intrinsic postzygotic reproductive barriers remains tenuous. Second, we discuss the important role of recombination suppressors in facilitating speciation with gene flow, but point out that the means and timing by which reproductive barriers become associated with recombination cold spots remains uncertain. Third, we establish the importance of ancient genetic variation in speciation, although we argue that the focus of speciation studies on evolutionarily young groups may bias conclusions in favor of ancient variation relative to new mutations.",

The process of developing conceptual models that summarize the literature using ad hoc approaches has high potential to be incomplete due to the challenges of tracking information and hypotheses across the literature. We present a novel, systematic approach to conceptual model development through qualitative synthesis and graphical analysis of hypotheses already present in the scientific literature. Our approach has five stages: researchers explicitly define the scope of the question, conduct a systematic review, extract hypotheses from prior studies, assemble hypotheses into a single network model and analyse trends in the model through network analysis. The resulting network can be analysed to identify shifts in thinking over time, variation in the application of ideas over different axes of investigation (e.g. geography, taxonomy, ecosystem type) and the most important hypotheses based on the network structure. To illustrate the approach, we present examples from a case study that applied the method to synthesize decades of research on the effects of forest fragmentation on birds. This approach can be used to synthesize scientific thinking across any field of research, guide future research to fill knowledge gaps efficiently and help researchers systematically build conceptual models representing alternative hypotheses.",

However, there is a need for complementary tools that help to (a) organize evidence, (b) organize theory, and (c) closely connect evidence to theory. We present the hierarchy-of-hypotheses (HoH) approach to address these issues. In an HoH, hypotheses are conceptually and visually structured in a hierarchically nested way where the lower branches can be directly connected to empirical results. Used for organizing evidence, this tool allows researchers to conceptually connect empirical results derived through diverse approaches and to reveal under which circumstances hypotheses are applicable. Used for organizing theory, it allows researchers to uncover mechanistic components of hypotheses and previously neglected conceptual connections. In the present article, we offer guidance on how to build an HoH, provide examples from population and evolutionary biology and propose terminological clarifications.",

Whilst LMMs offer a ﬂexible approach to modelling a broad range of data types, ecological data are often complex and require complex model structures, and the ﬁtting and interpretation of such models is not always straightforward. The ability to achieve robust biological inference requires that practitioners know how and when to apply these tools. Here, we provide a general overview of current methods for the application of LMMs to biological data, and highlight the typical pitfalls that can be encountered in the statistical modelling process. We tackle several issues regarding methods of model selection, with particular reference to the use of information theory and multi-model inference in ecology. We offer practical solutions and direct the reader to key references that provide further technical detail for those seeking a deeper understanding. This overview should serve as a widely accessible code of best practice for applying LMMs to complex biological problems and model structures, and in doing so improve the robustness of conclusions drawn from studies investigating ecological and evolutionary questions.",

		"abstract": "Reproductive isolation (RI) is a core concept in evolutionary biology. It has been the central focus of speciation research since the modern synthesis and is the basis by which biological species are defined. Despite this, the term is used in seemingly different ways, and attempts to quantify RI have used very different approaches. After showing that the field lacks a clear definition of the term, we attempt to clarify key issues, including what RI is, how it can be quantified in principle, and how it can be measured in practice. Following other definitions with a genetic focus, we propose that RI is a quantitative measure of the effect that genetic differences between populations have on gene flow. Specifically, RI compares the flow of neutral alleles in the presence of these genetic differences to the flow without any such differences. RI is thus greater than zero when genetic differences between populations reduce the flow of neutral alleles between populations. We show how RI can be quantified in a range of scenarios. A key conclusion is that RI depends strongly on circumstances—including the spatial, temporal and genomic context—making it difficult to compare across systems. After reviewing methods for estimating RI from data, we conclude that it is difficult to measure in practice. We discuss our findings in light of the goals of speciation research and encourage the use of methods for estimating RI that integrate organismal and genetic approaches.",

		"abstract": "Scientific investigation is of value only insofar as relevant results are obtained and communicated, a task that requires organizing, evaluating, analysing and unambiguously communicating the significance of data. In this context, working with ecological data, reflecting the complexities and interactions of the natural world, can be a challenge. Recent innovations for statistical analysis of multifaceted interrelated data make obtaining more accurate and meaningful results possible, but key decisions of the analyses to use, and which components to present in a scientific paper or report, may be overwhelming. We offer a 10-step protocol to streamline analysis of data that will enhance understanding of the data, the statistical models and the results, and optimize communication with the reader with respect to both the procedure and the outcomes. The protocol takes the investigator from study design and organization of data (formulating relevant questions, visualizing data collection, data exploration, identifying dependency), through conducting analysis (presenting, fitting and validating the model) and presenting output (numerically and visually), to extending the model via simulation. Each step includes procedures to clarify aspects of the data that affect statistical analysis, as well as guidelines for written presentation. Steps are illustrated with examples using data from the literature. Following this protocol will reduce the organization, analysis and presentation of what may be an overwhelming information avalanche into sequential and, more to the point, manageable, steps. It provides guidelines for selecting optimal statistical tools to assess data relevance and significance, for choosing aspects of the analysis to include in a published report and for clearly communicating information.",

If a random sample of their work (including scientific papers) produced before doing these courses were selected, half would probably contain violations of the underlying assumptions of the statistical techniques employed. 2. Some violations have little impact on the results or ecological conclusions; yet others increase type I or type II errors, potentially resulting in wrong ecological conclusions. Most of these violations can be avoided by applying better data exploration. These problems are especially troublesome in applied ecology, where management and policy decisions are often at stake. 3. Here, we provide a protocol for data exploration; discuss current tools to detect outliers, heterogeneity of variance, collinearity, dependence of observations, problems with interactions, double zeros in multivariate analysis, zero inflation in generalized linear modelling, and the correct type of relationships between dependent and independent variables; and provide advice on how to address these problems when they arise. We also address misconceptions about normality, and provide advice on data transformations. 4. Data exploration avoids type I and type II errors, among other problems, thereby reducing the chance of making wrong ecological conclusions and poor recommendations. It is therefore essential for good quality management and policy based on statistical analyses.",

We devised the method introduced here to address the difficulties encountered growing plants in seed germination pouches for long-term experiments and the high cost of other mini-rhizotron alternatives. Methods and Results The method described here took inspiration from homemade ant farms commonly used as an educational tool in elementary schools. Using compact disc (CD) cases, we developed mini-rhizotrons for use in the field and laboratory using the burclover Medicago lupulina. Conclusions Our method combines the benefits of pots and germination pouches. In CD mini-rhizotrons, plants grew significantly larger than in germination pouches, and unlike pots, it is possible to measure roots without destructive sampling. Our protocol is a cheaper, widely available alternative to more destructive methods, which could facilitate the study of belowground phenotypes and processes by scientists with fewer resources.",

		"abstract": "“Ecological” speciation occurs when reproductive isolation evolves as a consequence of divergent selection between populations exploiting different resources or environments. We tested this hypothesis of speciation in a young stickleback species pair by measuring the direct contribution of ecological selection pressures to hybrid fitness. The two species (limnetic and benthic) are strongly differentiated morphologically and ecologically, whereas hybrids are intermediate. Fitness of hybrids is high in the laboratory, especially F1 and F2 hybrids (backcrosses may show some breakdown). We transplanted F1 hybrids to enclosures in the two main habitats in the wild to test whether the distribution of resources available in the environment generates a hybrid disadvantage not detectable in the laboratory. Hybrids grew more slowly than limnetics in the open water habitat and more slowly than benthics in the littoral zone. Growth of F1 hybrids was inferior to the average of the parent species across both habitats, albeit not significantly. The contrast between laboratory and field results supports the hypothesis that mechanisms of F1 hybrid fitness in the wild are primarily ecological and do not result from intrinsic genetic incompatibilities. Direct selection on hybrids contributes to the maintenance of sympatric stickleback species and may have played an important role in their origin.",

In a perennial, outcrossing model plant Arabidopsis lyrata, several differentiated phenotypic traits contribute to local adaptation, as demonstrated by fitness advantage of the local population at each site in reciprocal transplant experiments. Here we compared fitness components, hierarchical total fitness and differentiation in putatively ecologically important traits of plants from two diverged parental populations from different continents in the native climate conditions of the populations in Norway and in North Carolina (NC, U.S.A.). Survival and number of fruits per inflorescence indicated local advantage at both sites and aster life-history models provided additional evidence for local adaptation also at the level of hierarchical total fitness. Populations were also differentiated in flowering start date and floral display. We also included reciprocal experimental F1 and F2 hybrids to examine the genetic basis of adaptation. Surprisingly, the F2 hybrids showed heterosis at the study site in Norway, likely because of a combination of beneficial dominance effects from different traits. At the NC site, hybrid fitness was mostly intermediate relative to the parental populations. Local cytoplasmic origin was associated with higher fitness, indicating that cytoplasmic genomes also may contribute to the evolution of local adaptation.",

		"abstract": "We performed transplant experiments with Louisiana irises to test the assumptions of three models of hybrid zone structure: the bounded hybrid superiority model, the mosaic model, and the tension zone model. Rhizomes of Iris fulva, I. hexagona, and F1 and F2 hybrids were planted at four sites in southeastern Louisiana in 1994. Wild irises grew at all four sites, but differed in genotypic composition among sites. The sites were characterized by (1) pure I. fulva plants; (2) I. fulva-like hybrids; (3) I. hexagona-like hybrids; and (4) pure I. hexagona plants. The sites differed significantly in light availability, soil moisture and chemical composition, and vegetation. Survival of transplants was high in all sites and did not differ significantly among plant classes. Iris hexagona produced significantly more leaf material than I. fulva at the I. hexagona and I. hexagona hybrid sites. The two species did not differ in leaf production at the I. fulva and I. fulva hybrid sites. Leaf production by both classes of hybrid was as great as, or significantly greater than, both parental classes in all sites. Iris hexagona rhizomes gained mass in the I. hexagona and I. hexagona hybrid sites, but lost mass in the I. fulva and I. fulva hybrid sites. Iris fulva rhizomes lost mass in all sites. There were no significant differences in rhizome growth among classes at the I. fulva site. At all other sites, F1 rhizomes grew significantly more than all other classes except for I. hexagona at the I. hexagona hybrid site. There were no significant differences among classes in the production of new ramets. Overall blooming frequencies were 30% for I. fulva, 10% for F1s, 3% for F2s, and 0.7% for I. hexagona. Blooming frequency did not differ among sites for I. fulva, but significantly more F1s bloomed at the I. hexagona site than at the I. fulva site. These results are inconsistent with all three models of hybrid zone structure. They suggest that once rhizomes become established, hybrids can reproduce by clonal growth as successfully as parents in all habitats, and can outperform them in some habitats. Clonal reproduction may ensure the long-term survival of early generation hybrids and allow the establishment of introgressed populations, despite the fact that F1 hybrids are rarely produced in nature.",

To realistically evaluate hybrid fitness and how environmental variation affects fitness in a long-lived species, all life stages must be considered. 2 We evaluated germination, seedling survival and growth of two Louisiana iris species and their early generation hybrids in several experimental environments created by manipulating light and water levels. 3 Species and hybrids all required similar moist conditions for germination. The proportion of germinated seeds was highest in shade and seedling survival highest in sun. 4 Iris brevicaulis exhibited the lowest germination and seedling survival overall, yet those individuals that survived grew vigorously. Iris fulva had high levels of germination and seedling survival, but yielded the smallest plants at the end of one season of growth. 5 Germination rates, seedling survival and seedling growth of hybrids equalled or exceeded one or both parent species, indicating that hybrids in this system have high relative fitness at seed and seedling stages in several environmental conditions. 6 We conclude that Iris fulva and I. brevicaulis share a common regeneration niche and similar early stage relative fitness with their hybrids. Thus, environment-dependent fitness in this system is due primarily to selection at adult stages.",

		"abstract": "Various models purporting to explain natural hybrid zones make different assumptions about the fitness of hybrids. One class of models assumes that hybrids have intrinsically low fitness due to genetic incompatibilities, whereas other models allow hybrid fitness to vary across natural environments. We used the intrinsic rate of increase to assess lifetime fitness of hybrids between two species of montane plants Ipomopsis aggregata and Ipomopsis tenuituba planted as seed into multiple field environments. Because fitness is predicted to depend upon genetic composition of the hybrids, we included F1 hybrids, F2 hybrids, and backcrosses in our field tests. The F2 hybrids had female fitness as high, or higher, than expected under an additive model of fitness. These results run counter to any model of hybrid zone dynamics that relies solely on intrinsic nuclear genetic incompatibilities. Instead, we found that selection was environmentally dependent. In this hybrid zone, cytoplasmic effects and genotype-by-environment interactions appear more important in lowering hybrid fitness than do intrinsic genomic incompatibilities between nuclear genes.",

		"abstract": "The outcome of secondary contact between divergent lineages or species may be influenced by both the reproductive traits of parental species and the fitness of offspring; however, their relative contributions have rarely been evaluated, particularly in longer-lived vertebrate species. We performed pure and reciprocal laboratory crosses between Ctenophorus decresii (tawny dragon) and C. modestus (swift dragon) to examine how parental reproductive traits and ecologically relevant offspring fitness traits may explain contact zone dynamics in the wild. The two species meet in a contact zone of post-F1 hybrids with asymmetric backcrossing and predominantly C. modestus mtDNA haplotypes. We found no evidence for reduced parental fecundity or offspring fitness for F1 hybrid crosses. However, maternal reproductive strategy differed between species, irrespective of the species of their mate. Ctenophorus modestus females had higher fecundity and produced more and larger clutches with lower embryonic mortality. Parental species also influenced sex ratios and offspring traits, with C. modestus ♀ × C. decresii ♂ hybrids exhibiting higher trait values for more fitness measures (growth rate, sprint speed, bite force) than offspring from all other pairings. Together, these patterns are consistent with the prevalence of C. modestus mtDNA in the contact zone, and asymmetric backcrossing likely reflects fitness effects that manifest in the F2 generation. Our results highlight how parental species can influence multiple offspring traits in different ways, which together may combine to influence offspring fitness and shape contact zone dynamics.",

		"abstract": "Hybridization is a major source of phenotypic variation and a driving force for evolution. Although novel hybrid traits can often disrupt adaptive relationships between the parental phenotypes and their environments, how new hybrid traits disrupt local adaptation remains unclear. Here, we report how a new phenotype of hybrids between two Imperata cylindrica ecotypes contributes to rapid reproductive isolation from their parents and affects hybrid fitness. We analysed 350 accessions of I. cylindrica collected from the 1980s to the 2010s throughout Japan to explore the genetic population structure of the hybrids. We surveyed the flowering periods, seed set, and germination of two ecotypes and their hybrids in both natural habitats and common gardens. Genetic analyses of population structure revealed that the hybrid populations consisted of only F1 individuals, without advanced generation hybrids. The flowering phenology of the F1 plants was delayed until autumn, 5–6 months later than the parental ecotypes. The drastic shift in flowering phenology prevents F1s from backcrossing. In addition, it changes their seed dispersal time to winter. Germination is inhibited by low temperatures, and the seeds likely decay before the next spring, resulting in the absence of an F2 generation. We identified the environmental mismatch of the F1 population as a specific mechanism for the maintenance of an only F1 population. Synthesis. We have demonstrated that this flowering phenology mismatch promotes reproductive isolation between the parents and F1s and affects various temporal components of the hybrids, resulting in a unique hybrid population consisting only of F1s. This system sheds light on the importance of hybrid traits in driving rapid reproductive isolation.",

Survival and flowering were recorded over 4 yr. At all transplant sites, the local species outperformed the foreign species, reciprocal F1 hybrids performed intermediately and F2 hybrids underperformed in comparison to F1 hybrids (hybrid breakdown). Females generally had slightly higher cumulative fitness than males in both within- and between-species crosses and we thus found little evidence for Haldane's rule acting on field performance. The strength of selection against F1 and F2 hybrids as well as hybrid breakdown increased with increasing strength of habitat adaptation (i.e. the relative fitness difference between the local and the foreign species) across sites. Our results suggest that differential habitat adaptation led to ecologically dependent post-zygotic reproductive barriers and drives divergence and speciation in this Silene system.",

At Tiryal Dag, northeast Turkey, Rhododendron×sochadzeae (R. ponticum×caucasicum) forms large populations in which neither segregation nor backcrossing occur, in habitats intermediate between those of its parents. Using single-copy species-specific random amplified polymorphic DNA and inter simple sequence repeat markers, it was determined that most or all R.×sochadzeae plants are F1s, and that there are many separate genets present. Hand pollination and germination experiments showed that R.×sochadzeae plants can produce viable seed of F2s or backcrosses in either direction. Furthermore, adult backcrosses have been observed in habitats atypical for R.×sochadzeae. From this, all non-F1 hybrid derivatives appear to be eliminated in the hybrid zone at Tiryal Dag as a result of postgermination selection. This absence of post-F1 hybrid derivatives apparently prevents introgression. This type of hybrid population is here termed an F1-dominated hybrid zone (F1DZ), and also occurs in Encelia. The observed dominance of F1s within a narrow habitat range is best explained by habitat-mediated superiority of F1s over all other genotype classes. Therefore, habitat-mediated selection against the second hybrid generation might be preventing interspecific gene flow in R.×sochadzeae. F1DZ formation is postulated to require the formation of F1s in quantity, habitat-mediated superiority in F1s, and highly specific habitat conditions.",

As Fisher, Haldane, and Wright established a century ago, Mendelian inheritance is exactly what is needed for natural selection to work efficiently. Yet, the synthesis remains unfinished. We do not understand why sexual reproduction and a fair meiosis predominate in eukaryotes, or how far these are responsible for their diversity and complexity. Moreover, although quantitative geneticists have long known that adaptive variation is highly polygenic, and that this is essential for efficient selection, this is only now becoming appreciated by molecular biologists—and we still do not have a good framework for understanding polygenic variation or diffuse function.",

		"abstract": "BACKGROUND: Heterosis is biologically important but the molecular basis of the phenomenon is poorly understood. We characterized intergeneric hybrids between B. rapa cv. Chiifu and R. sativus cv. WK10039 as an extreme example of heterosis. Taking advantage of clear heterosis phenotypes and the genetic distance between parents, we performed transcriptome and metabolite analysis to decipher the molecular basis of heterosis.\nRESULTS: The heterosis was expressed as fresh weight in the field and as inflorescence stem length in the glass house. Flowering time, distributed as a normal segregating population, ranged from the early flowering of one parent to the late flowering of the other, in contrast to the homogeneous flowering time in a typical F1 population, indicating unstable allelic interactions. The transcriptome and metabolome both indicated that sugar metabolism was altered, suggesting that the change in metabolism was linked to the heterosis. Because alleles were not shared between the hybridized genomes, classic models only partly explain this heterosis, indicating that other mechanisms are involved.\nCONCLUSION: The differential expression of genes for primary and secondary metabolism, along with the altered metabolite profiles, suggests that heterosis could involve a change in balance between primary and secondary metabolism.",

The analysis of the genetic architecture of heterosis revealed this to be caused by a higher portion of negative dominance and dominance-by-dominance epistatic effects.

		"abstract": "Natural selection plays a variety of roles in hybridization, speciation, and admixture. Most research has focused on two extreme cases: crosses between closely related inbred lines, where hybrids are fitter than their parents, or crosses between effectively isolated species, where hybrids suffer severe breakdown. But many natural populations must fall into intermediate regimes, with multiple types of gene interaction, and these are more difficult to study. Here, we develop a simple fitness landscape model, and show that it naturally interpolates between previous modeling approaches, which were designed for the extreme cases, and invoke either mildly deleterious recessives, or discrete hybrid incompatibilities. Our model yields several new predictions, which we test with genomic data from Mytilus mussels, and published data from plants (Zea, Populus, and Senecio) and animals (Mus, Teleogryllus, and Drosophila). The predictions are generally supported, and the model explains a number of surprising empirical patterns. Our approach enables novel and complementary uses of genome-wide datasets, which do not depend on identifying outlier loci, or “speciation genes” with anomalous effects. Given its simplicity and flexibility, and its predictive successes with a wide range of data, the approach should be readily extendable to other outstanding questions in the study of hybridization.",

		"abstract": "Research in speciation genetics has uncovered many robust patterns in intrinsic reproductive isolation, and fitness landscape models have been useful in interpreting these patterns. Here, we examine fitness landscapes based on Fisher's geometric model. Such landscapes are analogous to models of optimizing selection acting on quantitative traits, and have been widely used to study adaptation and the distribution of mutational effects. We show that, with a few modifications, Fisher's model can generate all of the major findings of introgression studies (including “speciation genes” with strong deleterious effects, complex epistasis and asymmetry), and the major patterns in overall hybrid fitnesses (including Haldane's Rule, the speciation clock, heterosis, hybrid breakdown, and male–female asymmetry in the F1). We compare our approach to alternative modeling frameworks that assign fitnesses to genotypes by identifying combinations of incompatible alleles. In some cases, the predictions are importantly different. For example, Fisher's model can explain conflicting empirical results about the rate at which incompatibilities accumulate with genetic divergence. In other cases, the predictions are identical. For example, the quality of reproductive isolation is little affected by the manner in which populations diverge.",

		"abstract": "We ask whether patterns of genetic variation in a phytophagous insect's responses to potential host plants shed light on the phylogenetic history of host association. Ophraella communa feeds chiefly, and in eastern North America exclusively, on Ambrosia (Asteraceae: Ambrosiinae). Using mostly half-sib breeding designs, we screened for genetic variation in feeding responses to and larval survival on its own host and on seven other plants that are hosts (or, on one case, closely related to the host) of other species of Ophraella. We found evidence for genetic variation in feeding responses to five of the seven test plants, other than the natural host. We found no evidence of genetic variation in feeding responses to two plant species, nor in capacity for larval survival on six. These results imply constraints on the availability of genetic variation; however, little evidence for constraints in the form of negative genetic correlations was found. These results are interpreted in the context of a provisional phylogeny of, and a history of host shifts within, the genus. Ophraella communa does not present evidence of genetic variation in its ability to feed and/or survive on Solidago, even though it is probably descended from a lineage that fed on Solidago or related plants, possibly as recently as 1.9 million years ago. Genetic variation in performance on this plant may have been lost. Based on evidence for genetic variation and on mean performance, by far the greatest potentiality for adaptation to a congener's host was evinced in responses to Iva frutescens, which not only is related and chemically similar to Ambrosia, but also is the host of a closely related species of Ophraella that may have been derived from an Ambrosia-associated ancestor. Genetic variation in O. communa's capacity to feed and/or survive on its congeners' hosts is less evident for plants that do not represent historically realized host shifts (with one exception) than for those that may (but see Note Added in Proof). The results offer some support for the hypothesis that the evolution of host shifts has been guided in part by constrained genetic variation.",

They are incompatible alleles that have evolved in separate populations and are exposed in hybrid offspring as hybrid sterility or lethality. In this study, we reveal a previously unconsidered mechanism promoting the formation of BDM incompatibilities, meiotic drive. Theoretical studies have evaluated the role that meiotic drive, the phenomenon whereby selfish elements bias their transmission to progeny at ratios above 50:50, plays in speciation, and have mostly concluded that drive could not result in speciation on its own. Using the model fungus Neurospora, we demonstrate that the large meiotic drive haplotypes, Sk-2 and Sk-3, contain putative sexual incompatibilities. Our experiments revealed that although crosses between Neurospora intermedia and Neurospora metzenbergii produce viable progeny at appreciable rates, when strains of N. intermedia carry Sk-2 or Sk-3 the proportion of viable progeny drops substantially. Additionally, it appears that Sk-2 and Sk-3 have accumulated different incompatibility phenotypes, consistent with their independent evolutionary history. This research illustrates how meiotic drive can contribute to reproductive isolation between populations, and thereby speciation.",

		"abstract": "Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities (DMIs) are a major component of reproductive isolation between species. DMIs imply negative epistasis and are exposed when two diverged populations hybridize. Mapping the locations of DMIs has largely relied on classical genetic mapping. Approaches to date are hampered by low power and the challenge of identifying DMI loci on the same chromosome, because strong initial linkage of parental haplotypes weakens statistical tests. Here, we propose new statistics to infer negative epistasis from haplotype frequencies in hybrid populations. When two divergent populations hybridize, the variance in heterozygosity at two loci decreases faster with time at DMI loci than at random pairs of loci. When two populations hybridize at near-even admixture proportions, the deviation of the observed variance from its expectation becomes negative for the DMI pair. This negative deviation enables us to detect intermediate to strong negative epistasis both within and between chromosomes. In practice, the detection window in hybrid populations depends on the demographic scenario, the recombination rate, and the strength of epistasis. When the initial proportion of the two parental populations is uneven, only strong DMIs can be detected with our method unless migration prevents parental haplotypes from being lost. We use the new statistics to infer candidate DMIs from three hybrid populations of swordtail fish. We identify numerous new DMI candidates, some of which are inferred to interact with several loci within and between chromosomes. Moreover, we discuss our results in the context of an expected enrichment in intrachromosomal over interchromosomal DMIs.",

		"abstract": "Interactions between species generate the functions on which ecosystems and humans depend. However, we lack an understanding of the risk that interaction loss poses to ecological communities. Here, we quantify the risk of interaction loss for 4,330 species interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across 6 continents. We estimate risk as a function of interaction vulnerability to extinction (likelihood of loss) and contribution to network feasibility, a measure of how much an interaction helps a community tolerate environmental perturbations. Remarkably, we find that more vulnerable interactions have higher contributions to network feasibility. Furthermore, interactions tend to have more similar vulnerability and contribution to feasibility across networks than expected by chance, suggesting that vulnerability and feasibility contribution may be intrinsic properties of interactions, rather than only a function of ecological context. These results may provide a starting point for prioritising interactions for conservation in species interaction networks in the future., A study of 4,330 species interactions from 41 empirical pollination and seed dispersal networks across six continents reveals that species interactions which are most vulnerable to extinction are also the most important for ecological community stability; moreover, vulnerable interactions that are important for stability tend to be important and vulnerable wherever they occur.",

		"abstract": "The number of naturally occurring taxa of Vitis reported for North Carolina has ranged from five to nine, with seven being recognized in this treatment. Widespread natural hybridization was believed earlier to be responsible for this discrepancy; however, clinal variation was determined to be a complicating factor in the systematics of Vitis, and accounts for substantial morphological differences within species. Clines exist in two of North Carolina's grapes, V. aestivalis and V. cinerea. Pubescent V. aestivalis var. aestivalis of the Coastal Plain and Piedmont gradually becomes more glabrous and more glaucous on the abaxial leaf surfaces with increasing elevation. Mountain forms are treated as V. aestivalis var. argentifolia. Vitis cinerea has a similar clinal variation with leaves becoming more glabrous with elevational increase. Relatively glabrous plants of the Piedmont and mountains are V. cinerea var. baileyana and pubescent plants of the Coastal Plain are V. cinerea var. floridana. The morphology of V. vulpina, V. labrusca, and V. rotundifolia remains constant throughout the state. Differences in phenology and ecological preference are believed to promote reproductive isolation within subgenus Vitis. Barriers are not completely effective, however, since five putative hybrids were located in natural populations.",

		"abstract": "Vitis (Vitaceae) is a taxonomically complicated genus with ca. 60 taxa divided into two subgenera, Vitis and Muscadinia. We used population genetic approaches to gain insights into the genetic diversity, patterns of evolutionary differentiation and to decipher the taxonomic status of some of the controversial taxa within the genus Vitis. The distance- and model-based analyses were used to examine the phylogenetic structure within the genus Vitis using simple sequence repeat (SSR) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) markers. The results closely matched the current classification, but some discrepancies in the identity of taxa at the specific and subspecific levels were still evident. The East Asia and the  North American Vitis exhibited strong divergence and each group showed further differentiation into several subgroups with North American subgroups roughly matching the described series. The model based cluster analysis indicated 14 clusters as optimum to explain the genetic structure within the genus Vitis with most clusters containing a moderate frequency of admixed genotypes suggesting interspecific gene flow within the subgenus Vitis. Hierarchical partitioning of molecular variation indicated that a significant amount of the total variation (~74 % and ~69 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively) is accounted for by intraspecific variation as compared to the levels due to genetic differentiation among species within series (~17 % and ~20 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively) and among series within the genus Vitis (~9 % and ~10 % for SSRs and AFLPs, respectively). Overall, Vitis possesses mild genetic structure characterized by reticulation and incomplete lineage sorting of ancestral polymorphisms.",

		"abstract": "The recent discovery of Roman vineyards in Britain [Antiquity 75 (2001) 745] based on both archaeological and palynological data has raised questions concerning the palynological record of viticulture in NW Europe. This paper presents data collected from 30 pollen traps and 29 soil pollen samples from within, and around, three organic vineyards in England. The soil trap data were collected over one flowering season. Within-vineyard pollen accumulation is compared with off-site accumulation and the soil pollen data. Although there is extremely high intravineyard variation in Vitis accumulation, the data confirm the role of stemflow transport and the exponential decrease in Vitis pollen accumulation with distance away from the vineyard. Pollen trap values of over 2% total pollen (TP) Vitis and soils with over 0.2% TP (based on 1000+ pollen sum) are likely to indicate the on-site presence of a vineyard. This is in accordance with the values recorded from known Roman vineyards in the Nene Valley. A compilation of occasional finds of Vitis pollen in England reveals typical values of 0.2% or less; although higher values are recorded, they are generally an artefact of a low total pollen count. However, the clustering of these occasional finds into the Roman and high Medieval periods suggests that long-distance Vitis influx increased during periods of widespread viticulture in NW Europe including England. The monitoring of Vitis pollen dispersal suggests that where encountered as part of routine pollen counting, the total pollen sum should be increased to ca. 1000 TP in order to establish a better estimate of the frequency of occurrence. This will allow palynology to play a less ambiguous part in the mapping of ancient viticulture.",

		"abstract": "The evolution of reproductive isolation among populations is often the result of selective forces. Among those, parasites exert strong selection on host populations and can thus also potentially drive reproductive isolation. This hypothesis has yet to be explicitly tested, and here we set up a multigenerational coevolution experiment to explore this possibility. Five lines of Tribolium castaneum were allowed to coevolve with their natural parasite, Nosema whitei; five paired lines of identical origin were maintained in the absence of parasites. After 17 generations, we measured resistance within and reproductive isolation between all lines. Host lines from the coevolution treatment had considerably higher levels of resistance against N. whitei than their paired host lines, which were maintained in the absence of parasites. Reproductive isolation was greater in the coevolved selection regime and correlated with phenotypic differentiation in parasite resistance between coevolved host lines. This suggests the presence of a selection-driven genetic correlation between offspring number and resistance. Our results show that parasites can be a driving force in the evolution of reproductive isolation and thus potentially speciation.",

		"abstract": "This study was the first to compare the transcriptomes of two grape phylloxera lineages feeding on a tolerant and susceptible host, respectively, and to identify DEGs involved in the molecular interaction with these hosts. Simple Summary Grape phylloxera is an American native insect pest that caused heavy damages to the vineyards worldwide since its spreading to wine regions since the 1850s. This insect, able to feed on leaves and roots, induces plant galls and manipulates the grapevine physiology leading to plant damage and may cause plant death. The most successful treatment was the use of mostly partially resistant rootstocks. The degree of resistance is affected by environment, grapevine management and the insect biotype. In this study, we analyse the interaction of insect biotypes feeding on particular host plants. Therefore we evaluated the gene expression of Phylloxera feeding on a susceptible host versus feeding on a rootstock in two different developmental stages. We discovered (mainly in advanced insect developmental stages) genes expressed in higher proportion in one insect compared to the other. These genes related to chemosensory; in plant physiology manipulation and root deformation and insect digestive traits may play a role in the plant-insect interaction determining plant resistance in response to the pest attack. Abstract Grape phylloxera is one of the most dangerous insect pests for worldwide viticulture. The leaf- and root-galling phylloxerid has been managed by grafting European grapevines onto American rootstock hybrids. Recent reports pinpoint the appearance of host-adapted biotypes, but information about the biomolecular characteristics underlying grape phylloxera biotypisation and its role in host performance is scarce. Using RNA-sequencing, we sequenced the transcriptome of two larval stages: L1 (probing) and L2-3 (feeding) larvae of two root-feeding grape phylloxera lineages feeding on the rootstock Teleki 5C (biotype C) and V. vinifera Riesling (biotype A). In total, 7501 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were commonly modulated by the two biotypes. For the probing larvae, we found an increased number of DEGs functionally associated with insect chemoreception traits, such as odorant-binding proteins, chemosensory proteins, ionotropic, odorant, and gustatory receptors. The transcriptomic profile of feeding larvae was enriched with DEGs associated with the primary metabolism. Larvae feeding on the tolerant rootstock Teleki 5C exhibited higher numbers of plant defense suppression-associated DEGs than larvae feeding on the susceptible host. Based on the identified DEGs, we discuss their potential role for the compatible grape phylloxera–Vitis interaction belowground. This study was the first to compare the transcriptomes of two grape phylloxera lineages feeding on a tolerant and susceptible host, respectively, and to identify DEGs involved in the molecular interaction with these hosts.

The roots of the cultivated V. vinifera cultivars and hybrids are highly susceptible to grape phylloxera feeding damage. The native range of this insect covers most of North America, and it is particularly abundant in the eastern and central United States. Phylloxera was introduced from North America to almost all grape-growing regions across five of the temperate zone continents. It devastated vineyards in each of these regions causing large-scale disruptions to grape growers, wine makers and national economies. In order to understand the population diversity of grape phylloxera in its native range, more than 500 samples from 19 States and 34 samples from the introduced range (northern California, Europe and South America) were genotyped with 32 simple sequence repeat markers. STRUCTURE, a model based clustering method identified five populations within these samples. The five populations were confirmed by a neighbor-joining tree and principal coordinate analysis (PCoA). These populations were distinguished by their Vitis species hosts and their geographic locations. Samples collected from California, Europe and South America traced back to phylloxera sampled in the northeastern United States on V. riparia, with some influence from phylloxera collected along the Atlantic Coast and Central Plains on V. vulpina. Reproductive statistics conclusively confirmed that sexual reproduction is common in the native range and is combined with cyclical parthenogenesis. Native grape phylloxera populations were identified to be under Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The identification of admixed samples between many of these populations indicates that shared environments facilitate sexual reproduction between different host associated populations to create new genotypes of phylloxera. This study also found that assortative mating might occur across the sympatric range of the V. vulpina west and V. cinerea populations.",

		"abstract": "The distribution of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris, the wild grapevine subspecies of Vitis vinifera L., has been dramatically reduced in its major sites of diﬀusion, at ﬁrst by the spread, over the last 150 years, of pathogens from North America and, more recently, with fragmentation of habitat and disbranching by humans. In this work, 418 wild grapevine samples, belonging to 78 populations, were collected in their main Mediterranean distribution areas, including the Caucasus area, and the extent of their genetic variability evaluated by analysing plastid microsatellite DNA polymorphism. Results show low haplotype diversity value, with ﬁve haplotypes detected within the analysed populations. The highest within-population haplotypic diversity, with the presence of all ﬁve detected haplotypes, was found in the Caucasus regions and in the central regions of Italy. The distribution of all detected haplotypes suggests the Caucasian region as the possible center of origin of Vitis vinifera subsp. silvestris. A principal plastid lineage was found to be ﬁxed in several locations, in the Northernmost European countries and in the Southern island of Sardinia. These results draw attention to two diﬀerent refugium sites in the Mediterranean basin and suggest that conservation priority should be given to grapevine populations still preserved in hotspots of these regions.",

		"abstract": "A paradigm shift away from null hypothesis significance testing seems in progress. Based on simulations, we illustrate some of the underlying motivations. First, p-values vary strongly from study to study, hence dichotomous inference using significance thresholds is usually unjustified. Second, ‘statistically significant’ results have overestimated effect sizes, a bias declining with increasing statistical power. Third, ‘statistically non-significant’ results have underestimated effect sizes, and this bias gets stronger with higher statistical power. Fourth, the tested statistical hypotheses usually lack biological justification and are often uninformative. Despite these problems, a screen of 48 papers from the 2020 volume of the Journal of Evolutionary Biology exemplifies that significance testing is still used almost universally in evolutionary biology. All screened studies tested default null hypotheses of zero effect with the default significance threshold of p = 0.05, none presented a pre-specified alternative hypothesis, pre-study power calculation and the probability of ‘false negatives’ (beta error rate). The results sections of the papers presented 49 significance tests on average (median 23, range 0–390). Of 41 studies that contained verbal descriptions of a ‘statistically non-significant’ result, 26 (63%) falsely claimed the absence of an effect. We conclude that studies in ecology and evolutionary biology are mostly exploratory and descriptive. We should thus shift from claiming to ‘test’ specific hypotheses statistically to describing and discussing many hypotheses (possible true effect sizes) that are most compatible with our data, given our statistical model. We already have the means for doing so, because we routinely present compatibility (‘confidence’) intervals covering these hypotheses.",

		"abstract": "Speciation is a central and fundamental process in evolution that concerns the origin of reproductive isolation. The latest generation of genomic approaches provide remarkable opportunities to describe speciation and to learn about its underlying mechanisms.Genome scans, which can now be carried out in a truly genome-wide scale and at base-pair resolution, reveal substantial genomic divergence among incipient species even in the face of gene flow and show that there is extensive genomic heterogeneity in the extent of differentiation, especially at early stages of speciation, both in sympatry and in allopatry.The sources of this heterogeneity remain incompletely understood. The combination of genome scans with sophisticated population genetic modelling, quantitative trait locus mapping, admixture analyses and ecology has the potential to distinguish the influence of selection from demographic, historical and structural effects and to link these sources of genomic divergence to phenotypes and to reproductive isolation.Available empirical data suggest that differentiation between parapatric populations can be restricted to few genomic islands, whereas incipient species that coexist in sympatry show differentiation that is widely distributed across the genome. This suggests that genomically widespread selection is required to permit the maintenance and perhaps the build-up of genetic differentiation in sympatry.Recent genomic studies reveal that the genetic basis of reproductive isolation is often complex. The effects of pleiotropy, genetic correlations and patterns of recombination need to be considered alongside effects of ecological and sexual selection as well as genomic conflict.A surprising recent discovery is the re-use of ancient genetic variants in speciation, which are acquired either from standing genetic variation or by introgressive hybridization.In this Review, we propose a 'roadmap' for the development of speciation genomics towards answering classical and emerging questions in speciation research.",

		"abstract": "Speciation, the accumulation of traits that prevent successful mating between populations, is a major source of biotic diversity. Most of the traits involved are by-products of adaptations that occur while species diverge in geographic isolation, but natural selection also acts directly to reduce mating between incipient species through a process called reinforcement. The genes involved in the evolution of one particular reinforcement trait have now been identified. A colour shift in the native Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii occurs in response to selection against hybridization with a closely related species. Dark-red flowers emerge (produced by the possible allelic combinations) as a result of mutations in two genes associated with synthesis of anthocyanin pigments. This result indicates that the evolution of reinforcement traits may involve only a small number of genetic changes with relatively large effect. This reinforcement trait can also reduce fitness in hybrid offspring, thus further facilitating the process of speciation.",

Using common-garden field experiments, we quantified the strength of reinforcing selection in nature by demonstrating strong selection favoring an allele conferring increased pigment intensity in the plant\n              Phlox drummondii\n              in areas of sympatry with the closely related species\n              Phlox cuspidata\n              . Incomplete hybrid sterility between the two species generates selection for traits that decrease interspecies hybridization. In contrast, selection on this locus is undetectable in the absence of\n              P. cuspidata\n              . We demonstrate that reinforcing selection is generated by nonrandom pollinator movement, in which pollinators move less frequently between intensely pigmented\n              P. drummondii\n              and\n              P. cuspidata\n              than between lightly pigmented\n              P. drummondii\n              and\n              P. cuspidata.",

		"abstract": "Character displacement, which arises when species diverge in sympatry to decrease competition for resources or reproductive interference, has been observed in a wide variety of plants and animals. A classic example of reproductive character displacement, presumed to be caused by reinforcing selection, is flower-color variation in the native Texas wildflower Phlox drummondii. Here, we use population genetic analyses to investigate molecular signatures of selection on flower-color variation in this species. First, we quantify patterns of neutral genetic variation across the range of P. drummondii to demonstrate that restricted gene flow and genetic drift cannot explain the pattern of flower-color divergence in this species. There is evidence of extensive gene flow across populations with different flower colors, suggesting selection caused flower-color divergence. Second, analysis of sequence variation in the genes underlying this divergence reveals a signature of a selective sweep in one of the two genes, further indicating selection is responsible for divergence in sympatry. The lack of a signature of selection at the second locus does not necessarily indicate a lack of selection on this locus but instead brings attention to the uncertainty in depending on molecular signatures to identify selection.",

		"abstract": "Multivariate statistical methods are derived for measuring selection solely from observed changes in the distribution of phenotypic characters in a population within a generation. Selective effects are readily detectable in characters that do not change with age, such as meristic traits or adult characters in species with determinate growth. Ontogenetic characters, including allometric growth rates, can be analyzed in longitudinal studies where individuals are followed through time. Following an approach pioneered by Pearson (1903), this analysis helps to reveal the target(s) of selection, and to quantify its intensity, without identifying the selective agent(s). By accounting for indirect selection through correlated characters, separate forces of directional and stabilizing (or disruptive) selection acting directly on each character can be measured. These directional and stabilizing selection coefficients are respectively the parameters that describe the best linear and quadratic approximations to the selective surface of individual fitness as a function of the phenotypic characters. The theory is illustrated by estimating selective forces on morphological characters influencing survival in pentatomid bugs and in house sparrows during severe weather conditions.",

		"abstract": "Genomic developments have empowered the investigation of heritability in wild populations directly from genomewide relatedness matrices (GRM). Such GRM-based approaches can in particular be used to improve or substitute approaches based on social pedigree (PED-social). However, measuring heritability from GRM in the wild has not been widely applied yet, especially using small samples and in nonmodel species. Here, we estimated heritability for four quantitative traits (tarsus length, wing length, bill length and body mass), using PED-social, a pedigree corrected by genetic data (PED-corrected) and a GRM from a small sample (n = 494) of blue tits from natural populations in Corsica genotyped at nearly 50,000 filtered SNPs derived from RAD-seq. We also measured genetic correlations among traits, and we performed chromosome partitioning. Heritability estimates were slightly higher when using GRM compared to PED-social, and PED-corrected yielded intermediate values, suggesting a minor underestimation of heritability in PED-social due to incorrect pedigree links, including extra-pair paternity, and to lower information content than the GRM. Genetic correlations among traits were similar between PED-social and GRM but credible intervals were very large in both cases, suggesting a lack of power for this small data set. Although a positive linear relationship was found between the number of genes per chromosome and the chromosome heritability for tarsus length, chromosome partitioning similarly showed a lack of power for the three other traits. We discuss the usefulness and limitations of the quantitative genetic inferences based on genomic data in small samples from wild populations.",

By analysing worldwide variation in six major traits critical to growth, survival and reproduction within the largest sample of vascular plant species ever compiled, we found that occupancy of six-dimensional trait space is strongly concentrated, indicating coordination and trade-offs. Three-quarters of trait variation is captured in a two-dimensional global spectrum of plant form and function. One major dimension within this plane reflects the size of whole plants and their parts; the other represents the leaf economics spectrum, which balances leaf construction costs against growth potential. The global plant trait spectrum provides a backdrop for elucidating constraints on evolution, for functionally qualifying species and ecosystems, and for improving models that predict future vegetation based on continuous variation in plant form and function.",

		"abstract": "Estimating the evolutionary potential of quantitative traits and reliably predicting responses to selection in wild populations are important challenges in evolutionary biology. The genomic revolution has opened up opportunities for measuring relatedness among individuals with precision, enabling pedigree-free estimation of trait heritabilities in wild populations. However, until now, most quantitative genetic studies based on a genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) have focused on long-term monitored populations for which traditional pedigrees were also available, and have often had access to knowledge of genome sequence and variability. Here, we investigated the potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating heritability in a free-ranging roe deer (Capreolous capreolus) population for which no prior genomic resources were available. We propose a step-by-step analytical framework to optimize the quality and quantity of the genomic data and explore the impact of the single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling and filtering processes on the GRM structure and GRM-based heritability estimates. As expected, our results show that sequence coverage strongly affects the number of recovered loci, the genotyping error rate and the amount of missing data. Ultimately, this had little effect on heritability estimates and their standard errors, provided that the GRM was built from a minimum number of loci (above 7,000). Genomic relatedness matrix-based heritability estimates thus appear robust to a moderate level of genotyping errors in the SNP data set. We also showed that quality filters, such as the removal of low-frequency variants, affect the relatedness structure of the GRM, generating lower h2 estimates. Our work illustrates the huge potential of RAD-sequencing for estimating GRM-based heritability in virtually any natural population.",

		"abstract": "Hosts and their symbionts are involved in intimate physiological and ecological interactions. The impact of these interactions on the evolution of each partner depends on the time-scale considered. Short-term dynamics – ‘coevolution’ in the narrow sense – has been reviewed elsewhere. We focus here on the long-term evolutionary dynamics of cospeciation and speciation following host shifts. Whether hosts and their symbionts speciate in parallel, by cospeciation, or through host shifts, is a key issue in host–symbiont evolution. In this review, we first outline approaches to compare divergence between pairwise associated groups of species, their advantages and pitfalls. We then consider recent insights into the long-term evolution of host–parasite and host–mutualist associations by critically reviewing the literature. We show that convincing cases of cospeciation are rare (7%) and that cophylogenetic methods overestimate the occurrence of such events. Finally, we examine the relationships between short-term coevolutionary dynamics and long-term patterns of diversification in host–symbiont associations. We review theoretical and experimental studies showing that short-term dynamics can foster parasite specialization, but that these events can occur following host shifts and do not necessarily involve cospeciation. Overall, there is now substantial evidence to suggest that coevolutionary dynamics of hosts and parasites do not favor long-term cospeciation. Contents Summary 347 I. Introduction 348 II.

		"abstract": "Testing the context and extent of host-parasite coevolution. Syst. Zool. 28:299– 307.—Coevolution is defined as a combination of two processes: co-accommodation between host and parasite with no implication of host or parasite speciation and co-speciation, indicating concomitant host and parasite speciation. Parasite speciation in general is viewed as primarily the result of allopatric speciation processes regardless of host speciation or changes in host type. The observation that co-speciation of hosts and parasites forms a predominant pattern relates to a more general principle of biotic allopatric speciation explicit in the vicariance biogeography model, more than to an assumption that host speciation somehow causes parasite speciation. The close ecological relationship between hosts and parasites, which may be depicted using a variation of the MacArthur-Wilson island biogeography model, explains their spatial proximity at any time during which an isolating event occurs and thus may be necessary in some cases, but is not sufficient to explain parasite speciation, coevolution, or parasite phylogeny.",

		"abstract": "Ecological speciation occurs when local adaptation generates reproductive isolation as a by-product of natural selection. Although ecological speciation is a fundamental source of diversification, the mechanistic link between natural selection and reproductive isolation remains poorly understood, especially in natural populations. Here, we show that experimental evolution of parasite body size over 4 y (approximately 60 generations) leads to reproductive isolation in natural populations of feather lice on birds. When lice are transferred to pigeons of different sizes, they rapidly evolve differences in body size that are correlated with host size. These differences in size trigger mechanical mating isolation between lice that are locally adapted to the different sized hosts. Size differences among lice also influence the outcome of competition between males for access to females. Thus, body size directly mediates reproductive isolation through its influence on both intersexual compatibility and intrasexual competition. Our results confirm that divergent natural selection acting on a single phenotypic trait can cause reproductive isolation to emerge from a single natural population in real time.",

		"abstract": "This study characterizes evolution at ≈1.86 million Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) within a natural population of yellow monkeyflower (Mimulus guttatus). Most SNPs exhibit minimal change over a span of 23 generations (less than 1% per year), consistent with neutral evolution in a large population. However, several thousand SNPs display strong fluctuations in frequency. Multiple lines of evidence indicate that these ‘Fluctuating SNPs’ are driven by temporally varying selection. Unlinked loci exhibit synchronous changes with the same allele increasing consistently in certain time intervals but declining in others. This synchrony is sufficiently pronounced that we can roughly classify intervals into two categories, “green” and “yellow,” corresponding to conflicting selection regimes. Alleles increasing in green intervals are associated with early life investment in vegetative tissue and delayed flowering. The alternative alleles that increase in yellow intervals are associated with rapid progression to flowering. Selection on the Fluctuating SNPs produces a strong ripple effect on variation across the genome. Accounting for estimation error, we estimate the distribution of allele frequency change per generation in this population. While change is minimal for most SNPs, diffuse hitchhiking effects generated by selected loci may be driving neutral SNPs to a much greater extent than classic genetic drift.",

		"abstract": "In China, ninety percent of the varieties of V. vinifera are protected from the cold by burying the vines for safe over-wintering, a labor-intensive practice that restricts the sustainable development of the grape and wine industry. An alternative solution is to breed cold-resistant varieties that can tolerate the local climatic conditions. The conventional cold-resistant breeding of grapes worldwide is mainly performed by the cross-breeding of wild species or V. labrusca and V. vinifera, so that new varieties obtain major cold-resistance genes from wild species or V. labrusca but maintain the high-quality genes of V. vinifera. However, there seems to be a close linkage between the major cold-resistance genes and the genes that control the poor characteristics of wild species or V. labrusca. The fruit traits of the hybrid progenies were unable to completely overcome the inheritance of the inferior traits of the wild parent or American parent. For grape genetic improvement for quality and disease-resistance, we propose use of minor-polygenes substitution and accumulation (MPSA) and intraspecific recurrent selection in V. vinifera (IRSV). “Ecolly” bred by this method has strong disease-, cold-, and drought- resistance, and is an excellent variety for brewing dry white wine and distilled spirits. At − 20 °C, the freezing damage degree of 50% winter buds of Ecolly ranged from 0.7 to 1.0, while the damage degree of Chardonnay ranged from 1.7 to 2.0. Thus, the variety is widely cultivated in many soil-burial over-wintering areas, but does not need to be buried to survive over-wintering. In summary, Ecolly is a successful case demonstrating the effectiveness of MPSA and IRSV for cold-resistance grape breeding, which provide a new thought for breeding new grapevine variety with cold resistance and quality brewing characteristics.",

		"abstract": "An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area-leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass-seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size-twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.",

		"abstract": "There are now thousands of estimates of phenotypic selection in natural populations, resulting in multiple synthetic reviews of these data. Here we consider several major lessons and limitations emerging from these syntheses, and how they may guide future studies of selection in the wild. First, we review past analyses of the patterns of directional selection. We present new meta-analyses that confirm differences in the direction and magnitude of selection for different types of traits and fitness components. Second, we describe patterns of temporal and spatial variation in directional selection, and their implications for cumulative selection and directional evolution. Meta-analyses suggest that sampling error contributes importantly to observed temporal variation in selection, and indicate that evidence for frequent temporal changes in the direction of selection in natural populations is limited. Third, we review the apparent lack of evidence for widespread stabilizing selection, and discuss biological and methodological explanations for this pattern. Finally, we describe how sampling error, statistical biases, choice of traits, fitness measures and selection metrics, environmental covariance and other factors may limit the inferences we can draw from analyses of selection coefficients. Current standardized selection metrics based on simple parametric statistical models may be inadequate for understanding patterns of non-linear selection and complex fitness surfaces. We highlight three promising areas for expanding our understanding of selection in the wild: (1) field studies of stabilizing selection, selection on physiological and behavioral traits, and the ecological causes of selection; (2) new statistical models and methods that connect phenotypic variation to population demography and selection; and (3) availability of the underlying individual-level data sets from past and future selection studies, which will allow comprehensive modeling of selection and fitness variation within and across systems, rather than meta-analyses of standardized selection metrics.",

For instance, learnPopGen functions can be used to visualize gene frequency changes through time under multiple deterministic and stochastic processes, to compute and animate the changes in phenotypic trait values or distributions under natural selection, to numerically analyze and graph the outcome of simple game theory models, and to plot coalescence within a population experiencing genetic drift, along with a number of other things. Functions have been designed to be maximally didactic and frequently employ compelling animated visualizations. Furthermore, it is straightforward to export plots and animations from R in the form of flat or animated graphics, or as videos. For maximum flexibility, students working with the package can run functions directly in R; however, instructors may choose to guide students less adept in the R environment to one of various web interfaces that I have built for a number of the functions of the package and that are already available online.",

Here, we show that relatively few allopatric pairs of birds, mammals, or amphibians exhibit trait differences consistent with models of divergent adaptation in each of many ecologically relevant traits. By fitting new evolutionary models to numerous sets of sister-pair trait differences, we find that speciating and recently speciated allopatric taxa seem to overwhelmingly evolve under similar rather than divergent macro–selective pressures. This contradicts the classical view of divergent adaptation as a prominent driver of the early stages of speciation and helps synthesize two historical controversies regarding the ecology and geography of species formation.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the phenotypic and genetic architecture of reproductive isolation is a longstanding goal of speciation research. In several systems, large-effect loci contributing to barrier phenotypes have been characterized, but such causal connections are rarely known for more complex genetic architectures. In this study, we combine ‘top-down’ and ‘bottom-up’ approaches with demographic modeling toward an integrated understanding of speciation across a monkeyflower hybrid zone. Previous work suggests that pollinator visitation acts as a primary barrier to gene flow between two divergent red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Several candidate isolating traits and anonymous SNP loci under divergent selection have been identified, but their genomic positions remain unknown. Here, we report findings from demographic analyses that indicate this hybrid zone formed by secondary contact, but that subsequent gene flow was restricted by widespread barrier loci across the genome. Using a novel, geographic cline-based genome scan, we demonstrate that candidate barrier loci are broadly distributed across the genome, rather than mapping to one or a few ‘islands of speciation.’ Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping reveals that most floral traits are highly polygenic, with little evidence that QTL co-localize, indicating that most traits are genetically independent. Finally, we find little evidence that QTL and candidate barrier loci overlap, suggesting that some loci contribute to other forms of reproductive isolation. Our findings highlight the challenges of understanding the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and reveal that barriers to gene flow aside from pollinator isolation may play an important role in this system.",

		"abstract": "Premise Variation in seed and seedling traits underlies how plants interact with their environment during establishment, a crucial life history stage. We quantified genetic-based variation in seed and seedling traits in populations of the annual plant Plantago patagonica across a natural aridity gradient, leveraging natural intraspecific variation to predict how populations might evolve in response to increasing aridity associated with climate change in the Southwestern U.S. Methods We quantified seed size, seed size variation, germination timing, and specific leaf area in a greenhouse common garden, and related these traits to the climates of source populations. We then conducted a terminal drought experiment to determine which traits were most predictive of survival under early-season drought. Results All traits showed evidence of clinal variation—seed size decreased, germination timing accelerated, and specific leaf area increased with increasing aridity. Populations with more variable historical precipitation regimes showed greater variation in seed size, suggestive of past selection shaping a diversified bet-hedging strategy mediated by seed size. Seedling height, achieved via larger seeds or earlier germination, was a significant predictor of survival under drought. Conclusions We documented substantial interspecific trait variation as well as clinal variation in several important seed and seedling traits, yet these slopes were often opposite to predictions for how individual traits might confer drought tolerance. This work shows that plant populations may adapt to increasing aridity via correlated trait responses associated with alternative life history strategies, but that trade-offs might constrain adaptive responses in individual traits.",

		"abstract": "Larger seeds have been shown to convey benefits for seedling survival but the mechanisms of this process are not well understood. In this study, seed size and seedling survival were compared for 2 sympatric cactus species, Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose and Ferocactus wislizeni (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose, in laboratory and field experiments in the northern Sonoran Desert. Both species have small seeds, but Ferocactus seeds are nearly twice as long and 3 times as heavy as those of Carnegiea. The difference in size is perpetuated after germination: new Ferocactus seedlings have 4 times the estimated volume of new Carnegiea seedlings. In an outdoor experiment, annual survivorship of both species was low but was 6 times higher for Ferocactus (6 seedlings, 8.1%) than Carnegiea (1 seedling, 1.4%). The pattern of seedling mortality in relation to temperature and rain suggests that, after the initial flush of seed and seedling predation, drought and heat took a greater toll on Carnegiea than Ferocactus seedlings, probably because the larger seedling volume of Ferocactus conferred greater drought tolerance. In addition, F. wislizeni could become established without benefit of nurse plants whereas C. gigantea could not; this might reflect differential tolerance to high soil temperatures. /// Se ha sido mostrado que las semillas más grandes tienen ventajas en la sobrevivencia de las plántulas pero no se entienden bien los mecanismos de este proceso. En este estudio, se compararon el tamaño de las semillas con la sobrevivencia de las plántulas de 2 especies simpátricas de cactáceas, Carnegiea gigantea (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose y Ferocactus wislizeni (Engelm.) Britt. & Rose, en experimentos del laboratorio y del campo en el norte del desierto de Sonora. Ambas especies tienen semillas pequeñas, pero las de Ferocactus son casi 2 veces más largas y 3 veces más pesadas que las de Carnegiea. La diferencia en el tamaño sigue después de la germinación: nuevas plántulas de Ferocactus tienen volumenes 4 veces más que los de nuevas plántulas de Carnegiea. En un experimento al aire libre la sobrevivencia fue baja pero fue anual de ambas especies, 6 veces más alta para plántulas de Ferocactus (6 plántulas, 8.1%) que las de Carnegiea (1 plántula, 1.4%). El patrón de la mortalidad de las plántulas en relación con la temperatura y la lluvia sugiere que la sequía y el calor matan más plántulas de Carnegiea que las de Ferocactus después del primer episodo de predación de las semillas y de las plántulas. La explicación más probable es que los volumenes más grandes de las semillas de Ferocactus confirieron más tolerencia a la sequía. Plantas de F. wislizeni también podrían ser establecidas sin el provecho de plantas protectoras mientras que C. gigantea no podría. Esto puede reflejar una tolerencia diferente a altas temperaturas del suelo.",

		"abstract": "An important aim of plant ecology is to identify leading dimensions of ecological variation among species and to understand the basis for them. Dimensions that can readily be measured would be especially useful, because they might offer a path towards improved worldwide synthesis across the thousands of field experiments and ecophysiological studies that use just a few species each. Four dimensions are reviewed here. The leaf mass per area–leaf lifespan (LMA-LL) dimension expresses slow turnover of plant parts (at high LMA and long LL), long nutrient residence times, and slow response to favorable growth conditions. The seed mass–seed output (SM-SO) dimension is an important predictor of dispersal to establishment opportunities (seed output) and of establishment success in the face of hazards (seed mass). The LMA-LL and SM-SO dimensions are each underpinned by a single, comprehensible tradeoff, and their consequences are fairly well understood. The leaf size–twig size (LS-TS) spectrum has obvious consequences for the texture of canopies, but the costs and benefits of large versus small leaf and twig size are poorly understood. The height dimension has universally been seen as ecologically important and included in ecological strategy schemes. Nevertheless, height includes several tradeoffs and adaptive elements, which ideally should be treated separately. Each of these four dimensions varies at the scales of climate zones and of site types within landscapes. This variation can be interpreted as adaptation to the physical environment. Each dimension also varies widely among coexisting species. Most likely this within-site variation arises because the ecological opportunities for each species depend strongly on which other species are present, in other words, because the set of species at a site is a stable mixture of strategies.",

		"abstract": "Despite long-standing theory for classifying plant ecological strategies, limited data directly links organismal traits to whole-plant growth rates. We compared trait-growth relationships based on three prominent theories: growth analysis, Grime's competitive-stress tolerant-ruderal (CSR) triangle, and the leaf economics spectrum (LES). Under these schemes, growth is hypothesized to be predicted by traits related to relative biomass investment, leaf structure, or gas exchange, respectively. We also considered traits not included in these theories, but that might provide potential alternative best predictors of growth. In phylogenetic analyses of 30 diverse milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) and 21 morphological and physiological traits, growth rate (total biomass produced per day) varied 50-fold and was best predicted by biomass allocation to leaves (as predicted by growth analysis) and the CSR traits of leaf size and leaf dry matter content. Total leaf area and plant height were also excellent predictors of whole-plant growth rates. Despite two LES traits correlating with growth (mass-based leaf nitrogen and area-based leaf phosphorus contents), these were in the opposite direction predicted by LES, such that higher N and P contents corresponded to slower growth. The remaining LES traits (e.g., leaf gas exchange) were not predictive of plant growth rates. Overall, differences in growth rate were driven more by whole-plant characteristics such as biomass fractions and total leaf area than individual leaf-level traits such as photosynthetic rate or specific leaf area. Our results are most consistent with classical growth analysis - combining leaf traits with whole-plant allocation to best predict growth. However, given that destructive biomass measures are often not feasible, applying easy-to-measure leaf traits associated with the CSR classification appear more predictive of whole plant growth than LES traits. Testing the generality of this result across additional taxa would further improve our ability to predict whole-plant growth from functional traits across scales.",

		"abstract": "Stress comprises three sequential stages: the event (stressor), which leads to an initial effect on a focal organism (stress), followed by the organism's ultimate response (recovery or not). Using this framework, we test how the duration and timing of a stressor individually and interactively affect the initial and asymptotic organism outcomes. We applied either long or short water restrictions either early or later in the life of Lepidium sativum. While several of these water restriction treatments caused a noticeable initial effect, all were able to recover fully, except for those exposed to a long early water restriction. While long early stressors led to decreased height, a growth model revealed that both long and short early stressors changed the rate of growth and prolonged the inflection point, findings that would have been missed had effect and response not been analyzed separately. Both the stressor and the magnitude of the initial effect in part explained the change in the growth model parameter estimates. Overall, timing, duration, and, more importantly, the interaction of these two temporal aspects of stress significantly affects an organism's initial response to a stressor and its ability to ultimately recover from stress. Our findings highlight the importance of explicitly studying the interactions of stressor aspects and of examining the immediate stress effects, as well as long-term responses.",

		"abstract": "Genetic population differentiation is typically viewed as differentiation of population means. However, several theories of evolution and speciation postulate that populations differentiate not only with respect to the population means, but also with respect to the effects of alleles within these populations. I develop herein a measure of population differentiation for the ‘local average effects’ of alleles, where local average effect is defined as the average effect of an allele in a deme measured as a deviation from the metapopulation mean. The differentiation for local average effects has two components, a component attributable to the population mean and a residual component that is attributable to changes in the local average effects independent of the population mean. The variance in local average effects attributable to the population mean is measured as the variance in the mean local average effect of all alleles. The variance in the residual local average effects is measured as the difference between the variance local average effects of individual alleles and the variance in the mean local average effects of all alleles. Differentiation for population means and differentiation for residual local average effects need not be related. I show that when there is only additive gene action, populations can differentiate for population means, but not for residual local average effects. However, if there is gene interaction then populations can also differentiate for local average effects of alleles. The consequence of this differentiation is that the local average effects of alleles change relative to each other such that an allele that is favoured by selection in one population may be removed by selection in other populations. I discuss the evolutionary consequences of differentiation for local average effects, and the interpretation of QTL data in light of this model.",

Several statistics have been proposed that are useful for different purposes.Recombination interacts in a complex way with selection, mutation and genetic drift to determine levels of LD. As a consequence, local and genome-wide patterns of LD can provide insight into patterns of natural selection and the past history of population growth and dispersal.In humans and other model organisms, LD between marker alleles and traits of interest allow fine-scale gene mapping. Many recent genome-wide association studies have successfully mapped SNPs associated with complex inherited diseases in humans.Unusually high local LD can indicate an allele that has recently increased to high frequency under strong selection. Several methods have been developed to detect selected loci and to estimate the age of alleles using patterns of LD.In humans, the analysis of LD is well underway.

Crosses between natural populations can result in heterosis if recessive or nearly recessive deleterious mutations have become fixed within populations because of genetic drift. Divergence between populations can also result in outbreeding depression because of genetic incompatibilities. The net fitness consequences of between-population crosses will be a balance between heterosis and outbreeding depression. We estimated the magnitude of heterosis and outbreeding depression in the highly selfing model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, by crossing replicate line pairs from two sets of natural populations (C↔R, B↔S) separated by similar geographic distances (Italy↔Sweden). We examined the contribution of different modes of gene action to overall differences in estimates of lifetime fitness and fitness components using joint scaling tests with parental, reciprocal F1 and F2, and backcross lines. One of these population pairs (C↔R) was previously demonstrated to be locally adapted, but locally maladaptive quantitative trait loci were also found, suggesting a role for genetic drift in shaping adaptive variation. We found markedly different genetic architectures for fitness and fitness components in the two sets of populations. In one (C↔R), there were consistently positive effects of dominance, indicating the masking of recessive or nearly recessive deleterious mutations that had become fixed by genetic drift. The other set (B↔S) exhibited outbreeding depression because of negative dominance effects.

		"abstract": "We present a quantitative genetic (QG) interpretation of the Bateson‐Dobzhansky‐Muller (BDM) genetic model of speciation in order to unify the theoretical framework for understanding how the genetic differentiation of populations is associated with the process of speciation. Specifically, we compare the QG theory of joint scaling with the Turelli‐Orr mathematical formulation of the BDM model. By formally linking the two models, we show that a wealth of empirical methods from QG can be brought to bear on the study of the genetic architecture of hybrid phenotypes to better understand the connections, if any, between microevolution within populations and macroevolution in the origin of species. By integrating the two theories, we make additional novel predictions that enrich the opportunities for empirically testing speciation genetic theory or facets of it, such as Haldane’s rule. We show that the connection between the two theories is simple and straightforward for autosomal genes but not for sex‐linked genes. Differences between the two approaches highlight key conceptual issues concerning the relevance of epistasis to evolution within and among lineages and to differences in the process of speciation in hermaphrodites and in organisms with separate sexes.",

		"abstract": "The sterility and inviability of species hybrids can be explained by between-locus “Dobzhansky-Muller” incompatibilities: alleles that are fit on their “normal” genetic backgrounds sometimes lower fitness when brought together in hybrids. We present a model of two-locus incompatibilities that distinguishes among three types of hybrid interactions: those between heterozygous loci (H0), those between a heterozygous and a homozygous (or hemizygous) locus (H1), and those between homozygous loci (H2). We predict the relative fitnesses of hybrid genotypes by calculating the expected numbers of each type of incompatibility. We use this model to study Haldane's rule and the large effect of X chromosomes on postzygotic isolation. We show that the severity of H0 vs. H1 incompatibilities is key to understanding Haldane's rule, while the severity of H1 vs. H2 incompatibilities must also be considered to explain large X effects. Large X effects are not inevitable in backcross analyses but rather—like Haldane's rule—may often reflect the recessivity of alleles causing postzygotic isolation. We also consider incompatibilities involving the Y (or W) chromosome and maternal effects. Such incompatibilities are common in Drosophila species crosses, and their consequences in male- vs. female-heterogametic taxa may explain the pattern of exceptions to Haldane's rule.",

Such processes often occur simultaneously and have important implications for the evolution of mating systems, dispersal strategies, and speciation. They are also relevant to the design of breeding strategies for captive populations of endangered species. A general expression is presented for the expected phenotype of an individual under the joint influence of inbreeding and crossbreeding. This expression is a simple function of the inbreeding coefficient, of source and hybridity indices of crossbreeding, and of specific forms of gene action. Application of the model may be of use in identifying the mechanistic bases for a number of evolutionary phenomena such as the shift from outbreeding enhancement to outbreeding depression that occurs with population divergence.",

		"abstract": "When divergent populations form hybrids, hybrid fitness can vary with genome composition, current environmental conditions, and the divergence history of the populations. We develop analytical predictions for hybrid fitness, which incorporate all three factors. The predictions are based on Fisher's geometric model, and apply to a wide range of population genetic parameter regimes and divergence conditions, including allopatry and parapatry, local adaptation, and drift. Results show that hybrid fitness can be decomposed into intrinsic effects of admixture and heterozygosity, and extrinsic effects of the (local) adaptedness of the parental lines. Effect sizes are determined by a handful of geometric distances, which have a simple biological interpretation. These distances also reflect the mode and amount of divergence, such that there is convergence toward a characteristic pattern of intrinsic isolation. We next connect our results to the quantitative genetics of line crosses in variable or patchy environments. This means that the geometrical distances can be estimated from cross data, and provides a simple interpretation of the “composite effects.” Finally, we develop extensions to the model, involving selectively induced disequilibria, and variable phenotypic dominance. The geometry of fitness landscapes provides a unifying framework for understanding speciation, and wider patterns of hybrid fitness.",

Patterns of fitness variation in the field can show whether natural selection drives local adaptation and ecotype formation. However, to demonstrate a link between ecological divergence and speciation, local adaptation must have consequences for reproductive isolation. Using contrasting ecotypes of an Australian wildflower, Senecio lautus in common garden experiments, hybridization experiments, and reciprocal transplants, we assessed how the environment shapes patterns of adaptation and the consequences of adaptive divergence for reproductive isolation. Local adaptation was strong between ecotypes, but weaker between populations of the same ecotype. F1 hybrids exhibited heterosis, but crosses involving one native parent performed better than those with two foreign parents. In a common garden experiment, F2 hybrids exhibited reduced fitness compared to parentals and F1 hybrids, suggesting that few genetic incompatibilities have accumulated between populations adapted to contrasting environments. Our results show how ecological differences across the landscape have created complex patterns of local adaptation and reproductive isolation, suggesting that divergent natural selection has played a fundamental role in the early stages of species diversification.",

		"abstract": "Speciation is driven by the evolution of reproductive isolating barriers that reduce, and ultimately prevent, substantial gene flow between lineages. Despite its central role in evolutionary biology, the process can be difficult to study because it proceeds differently among groups and may occur over long timescales. Due to this complexity, we typically rely on generalizations of empirical data to describe and understand the process. Previous reviews of reproductive isolation (RI) in flowering plants have suggested that prezygotic or extrinsic barriers generally have a stronger effect on reducing gene flow compared to postzygotic or intrinsic barriers. Past conclusions have rested on relatively few empirical estimates of RI; however, RI data have become increasingly abundant over the past 15 years. We analyzed data from recent studies quantifying multiple pre- and postmating barriers in plants and compared the strengths of isolating barriers across 89 taxa pairs using standardized RI metrics. Individual prezygotic barriers were on average stronger than individual postzygotic barriers, and the total strength of prezygotic RI was approximately twice that of postzygotic RI. These findings corroborate that ecological divergence and extrinsic factors, as opposed to solely the accumulation of genetic incompatibilities, are important to speciation and the maintenance of species boundaries in plants. Despite an emphasis in the literature on asymmetric postmating and postzygotic RI, we found that prezygotic barriers acted equally asymmetrically. Overall, substantial variability in the strengths of 12 isolating barriers highlights the great diversity of mechanisms that contribute to plant diversification.",

		"abstract": "Both chromosomal rearrangements and negative interactions among loci (Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities) have been advanced as the genetic mechanism underlying the sterility of interspecific hybrids. These alternatives invoke very different evolutionary histories during speciation and also predict different patterns of sterility in artificial hybrids. Chromosomal rearrangements require drift, inbreeding, or other special conditions for initial fixation and, because heterozygosity per se generates any problems with gamete formation, F1 hybrids will be most infertile. In contrast, Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities may arise as byproducts of adaptive evolution and often affect the segregating F2 generation most severely. To distinguish the effects of these two mechanisms early in divergence, we investigated the quantitative genetics of hybrid sterility in a line cross between two members of the Mimulus guttatus species complex (M. guttatus and M. nasutus). Hybrids showed partial male and female sterility, and the patterns of infertility were not consistent with the action of chromosomal rearrangements alone. F2 and F1 hybrids exhibited equal decreases in pollen viability (> 40%) relative to the highly fertile parental lines. A large excess of completely pollen-sterile F2 genotypes also pointed to the segregation of Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibility factors affecting male fertility. Female fertility showed a pattern similarly consistent with epistatic interactions: F2 hybrids produced far fewer seeds per flower than F1 hybrids (88.0 ± 2.8 vs. 162.9 ± 8.5 SE, respectively) and either parental line, and many F2 genotypes were completely female sterile. Dobzhansky-Muller interactions also resulted in the breakdown of several nonreproductive characters and appear to contribute to correlations between male and female fertility in the F2 generation.

		"abstract": "Adaptation to contrasting environments occurs when advantageous alleles accumulate in each population, but it remains largely unknown whether these same advantageous alleles create genetic incompatibilities that can cause intrinsic reproductive isolation leading to speciation. Identifying alleles that underlie both adaptation and reproductive isolation is further complicated by factors such as dominance and genetic interactions among loci, which can affect both processes differently and obscure potential links between adaptation and speciation. Here, we use a combination of field and glasshouse experiments to explore the connection between adaptation and speciation while accounting for dominance and genetic interactions. We created a hybrid population with equal contributions from four contrasting ecotypes of Senecio lautus (Asteraceae), which produced hybrid genomes both before (F1 hybrid generation) and after (F4 hybrid generation) recombination among the parental ecotypes. In the glasshouse, plants in the second generation (F2 hybrid generation) showed reduced fitness as a loss of fertility. However, fertility was recovered in subsequent generations, suggesting that genetic variation underlying the fitness reduction was lost in subsequent generations. To quantify the effects of losing genetic variation at the F2 generation on the fitness of later generation hybrids, we used a reciprocal transplant to test for fitness differences between parental ecotypes, and F1 and F4 hybrids in all four parental habitats. Compared to the parental ecotypes and F1 hybrids, variance in F4 hybrid fitness was lower, and lowest in habitats that showed stronger native-ecotype advantage, suggesting that stronger natural selection for the native ecotype reduced fitness variation in the F4 hybrids. Fitness trade-offs that were present in the parental ecotypes and F1 hybrids were absent in the F4 hybrid. Together, these results suggest that the genetic variation lost after the F2 generation was likely associated with both adaptation and intrinsic reproductive isolation among ecotypes from contrasting habitats.",

		"abstract": "Despite long-standing theory for classifying plant ecological strategies, limited data directly link organismal traits to whole-plant growth rates (GRs). We compared trait-growth relationships based on three prominent theories: growth analysis, Grime's competitive–stress tolerant–ruderal (CSR) triangle, and the leaf economics spectrum (LES). Under these schemes, growth is hypothesized to be predicted by traits related to relative biomass investment, leaf structure, or gas exchange, respectively. We also considered traits not included in these theories but that might provide potential alternative best predictors of growth. In phylogenetic analyses of 30 diverse milkweeds (Asclepias spp.) and 21 morphological and physiological traits, GR (total biomass produced per day) varied 50-fold and was best predicted by biomass allocation to leaves (as predicted by growth analysis) and the CSR traits of leaf size and leaf dry matter content. Total leaf area (LA) and plant height were also excellent predictors of whole-plant GRs. Despite two LES traits correlating with growth (mass-based leaf nitrogen and area-based leaf phosphorus contents), these were in the opposite direction of that predicted by LES, such that higher N and P contents corresponded to slower growth. The remaining LES traits (e.g., leaf gas exchange) were not predictive of plant GRs. Overall, differences in GR were driven more by whole-plant characteristics such as biomass fractions and total LA than individual leaf-level traits such as photosynthetic rate or specific leaf area. Our results are most consistent with classical growth analysis—combining leaf traits with whole-plant allocation to best predict growth. However, given that destructive biomass measures are often not feasible, applying easy-to-measure leaf traits associated with the CSR classification appear more predictive of whole-plant growth than LES traits. Testing the generality of this result across additional taxa would further improve our ability to predict whole-plant growth from functional traits across scales.",

		"abstract": "Growth is a widely used term in plant science and ecology, but it can have different meanings depending on the context and the spatiotemporal scale of analysis. At the meristem level, growth is associated with the production of cells and initiation of new organs. At the organ or plant scale and over short time periods, growth is often used synonymously with tissue expansion, while over longer time periods the increase in biomass is a common metric. At even larger temporal and spatial scales, growth is mostly described as net primary production. Here, we first address the question ‘what is growth?’. We propose a general framework to distinguish between the different facets of growth, and the corresponding physiological processes, environmental drivers and mathematical formalisms. Based on these different definitions, we then review how plant growth can be measured and analysed at different organisational, spatial and temporal scales. We conclude by discussing why gaining a better understanding of the different facets of plant growth is essential to disentangle genetic and environmental effects on the phenotype, and to uncover the causalities around source or sink limitations of plant growth.",

		"abstract": "Seed size affects individual fitness in wild plant populations, but its ability to evolve may be limited by low narrow-sense heritability (h2). h2 is estimated as the proportion of total phenotypic variance (σ2P) attributable to additive genetic variance (σ2A), so low values of h2 may be due to low σ2A (potentially eroded by natural selection) or to high values of the other factors that contribute to σ2P, such as extranuclear maternal effects (m2) and environmental variance effects (e2). Here, we reviewed the published literature and performed a meta-analysis to determine whether h2 of seed size is routinely low in wild populations and, if so, which components of σ2P contribute most strongly to total phenotypic variance. We analyzed available estimates of narrow-sense heritability (h2) of seed size, as well as the variance components contributing to these parameters. Maternal and environmental components of σ2P were significantly greater than σ2A, dominance, paternal, and epistatic components. These results suggest that low h2 of seed size in wild populations (the mean value observed in this study was 0.13) is due to both high values of maternally derived and environmental (residual) σ2, and low values of σ2A in seed size. The type of breeding design used to estimate h2 and m2 also influenced their values, with studies using diallel designs generating lower variance ratios than nested and other designs. e2 was not influenced by breeding design. For some breeding designs, the number of genotypes included in a study also influenced the resulting h2 and e2 estimates, but not m2. Our data support the view that a diallel design is better suited than the alternatives for the accurate estimation of σ2A in seed size due to its factorial design and the inclusion of reciprocal crosses, which allows the independent estimation of both additive and non-additive components of variance.",

		"abstract": "Central to Wright's shifting-balance theory is the idea that genetic drift and selection in systems with gene interaction can lead to the formation of \"adaptive gene complexes.\" The theory of genetic drift hasbeen well developed over the last 60 years; however, nearly all of this theory is based on the assumption that only additive gene effects are acting. Wright's theory was developed recognizing that there was a \"universality of interaction effects,\" which implies that additive theory may not be adequate to describe the process of differentiation that Wright was considering. The concept of an adaptive gene complex implies that an allele that is favored by individual selection in one deme may be removed by selection in another deme. In quantitative genetic terms, the average effects of an allele relative to other alleles changes from deme to deme. The model presented here examines the variance in local breeding values (LBVs) of a single individual and the covariance in the LBVs of a pair of individuals mated in the same deme relative to when they are mated in different demes. Local breeding value is a measure of the average effects of the alleles that make up that individual in a particular deme. I show that when there are only additive effects the covariance between the LBVs of individuals equals the variance in the LBV of an individual. As the amount of epistasis in the ancestral population increases, the variance in the LBV of an individual increases and the covariance between the LBVs of a pair of individuals decreases. The divergence in these two values is a measure of the extent to which the LBV of an individual varies independently of the LBVs of other individuals. When this value is large, it means that the relative ordering of the average effects of alleles will change from deme to deme. These results confirm an important component of Wright's shifting-balance theory: When there is gene interaction, genetic drift can lead to the reordering of the average effects of alleles and when coupled with selection this will lead to the formation of the adaptive gene complexes.",

Progress toward speciation in this model consists of association of a third locus, at which there is assortative mating, with the original two loci. Cases can be found in which speciation cannot occur. The evolutionary force acting against speciation turns out to be recombination, which acts to randomize the association between the prezygotic isolating mechanism (assortative mating) and the adaptations to the two environments. This model suggests that there is an important distinction between two kinds of speciation. One involves speciation by substitution of the same alleles in the two nascent species, the other by substitution of different alleles.

		"abstract": "We critically review the two major theories of adaptive evolution developed early in this century, Wright's shifting balance theory and Fisher's large population size theory, in light of novel findings from field observations, laboratory experiments, and theoretical research conducted over the past 15 years. Ecological studies of metapopulations have established that the processes of local extinction and colonization of demes are relatively common in natural populations of many species and theoretical population genetic models have shown that these ecological processes have genetic consequences within and among local demes. Within demes, random genetic drift converts nonadditive genetic variance into additive genetic variance, increasing, rather than limiting, the potential for adaptation to local environments. For this reason, the genetic differences that arise by drift among demes, can be augmented by local selection. The resulting adaptive differences in gene combinations potentially contribute to the genetic origin of new species. These and other recent findings were not discussed by either Wright or Fisher. For example, although Wright emphasized epistatic genetic variance, he did not discuss the conversion process. Similarly, Fisher did not discuss how the average additive effect of a gene varies among demes across a metapopulation whenever there is epistasis. We discuss the implications of such recent findings for the Wright-Fisher controversy and identify some critical open questions that require additional empirical and theoretical study.",

		"abstract": "We investigated the effect of nonadditive genetic variance on the amount of additive genetic variance within local populations in an infinite-allele, infinite-island model with migration, extinction, and recolonization, using two-locus descent measures. For an island model with extinction, one- and two-locus descent measures are expressed in a matrix form that allows equilibrium solutions to be calculated similar to previous work on Wright's F-statistics. In a subdivided population, the additive genetic variation within a local deme depends on the dominance and epistatic genetic variation in the species. Moreover, to a good approximation, the amount of additive variance within a deme is a simple function of Fst, which is twice the demic fraction of genic variance. At equilibrium, it is equal to (1 – Fst) VA plus 4 Fst (1 – Fst) VA×A, where VA and VA×A are the additive and additive × additive epistatic variances at the level of the species, respectively, plus a contribution from the dominance variance and other terms including dominance. Paradoxically, with nonadditive genetic effects, drift on average increases the amount of additive genetic variance within populations, whereas migration decreases the equilibrium amount. In the presence of nonadditive genetic effects, measurements of additive genetic variance in natural populations must be taken at the proper spatial scale with respect to natural selection, or they will provide an inaccurate description of evolutionary potential both within local populations and within the species as a whole.",

		"abstract": "Existing theory for inferences about linkage disequilibrium is restricted to a measure defined on gametic frequencies. Unless gametic frequencies are directly observable, they are inferred from genotypic frequencies under the assumption of random union of gametes. Primary emphasis in this paper is given to genotypic data, and disequilibrium coefficients are defined for all subsets of two or more of the four genes, two at each of two loci, carried by an individual. Linkage disequilibrium coefficients are defined for genes within and between gametes, and methods of estimating and testing these coefficients are given for gametic data. For genotypic data, when coupling and repulsion double heterozygotes cannot be distinguished, Burrows' composite measure of linkage disequilibrium is discussed. In particular, the estimate for this measure and hypothesis tests based on it are compared to the usual maximum likelihood estimate of gametic linkage disequilibrium, and corresponding likelihood ratio or contingency chi-square tests. General use of the composite measure, whether or not random union of gametes is an appropriate assumption, is recommended. Attention is given to small samples, where the non-normality of gene frequencies will have greatest effect on methods of inference based on normal theory. Even tools such as Fisher's z-transformation for the correlation of gene frequencies are found to perform quite satisfactorily.",

		"abstract": "Although epistasis is at the center of the Fisher-Wright debate, biologists not involved in the controversy are often unaware that there are actually two different formal definitions of epistasis. We compare concepts of genetic independence in the two theoretical traditions of evolutionary genetics, population genetics and quantitative genetics, and show how independence of gene action (represented by the multiplicative model of population genetics) can be different from the absence of gene interaction (represented by the linear additive model of quantitative genetics). The two formulations converge with weak selection but not with strong selection or, for multiple loci, when the aggregated interaction terms are not negligible. As a result of the different formulations of gene interaction, the presence or absence of linkage disequilibrium, D, does not necessarily indicate the presence or absence of fitness epistasis. Indeed, linkage disequilibrium is generated in ‘additive’ models in quantitative genetics whenever two (or more) loci experience simultaneous selection. As a research strategy, it is often practical, for theoretical or experimental reasons, to minimize gene interaction by assuming independence of gene action in regard to fitness, or by assuming linear additive effects of multiple loci on a phenotype. However, minimizing the role of epistasis in theoretical investigations hinders our understanding of the origins of diversity and the evolution of complex phenotypes.",

		"abstract": "We apply new analytical methods to understand the consequences of population bottlenecks for expected additive genetic variance. We analyze essentially all models for multilocus epistasis that have been numerically simulated to demonstrate increased additive variance. We conclude that for biologically plausible models, large increases in expected additive variance-attributable to epistasis rather than dominance-are unlikely. Naciri-Graven and Goudet (2003) found that as the number of epistatically interacting loci increases, additive variance tends to be inflated more after a bottleneck. We argue that this result reflects biologically unrealistic aspects of their models. Specifically, as the number of loci increases, higher-order epistatic interactions become increasingly important in these models, with an increasing fraction of the genetic variance becoming nonadditive, contrary to empirical observations. As shown by Barton and Turelli (2004), without dominance, conversion of nonadditive to additive variance depends only on the variance components and not on the number of loci per se. Numerical results indicating that more inbreeding is needed to produce maximal release of additive variance with more loci follow directly from our analytical results, which show that high levels of inbreeding (F > 0.5) are needed for significant conversion of higher-order components. We discuss alternative approaches to modeling multilocus epistasis and understanding its consequences.",

		"abstract": "We analyze the changes in the mean and variance components of a quantitative trait caused by changes in allele frequencies, concentrating on the effects of genetic drift. We use a general representation of epistasis and dominance that allows an arbitrary relation between genotype and phenotype for any number of diallelic loci. We assume initial and final Hardy-Weinberg and linkage equilibrium in our analyses of drift-induced changes. Random drift generates transient linkage disequilibria that cause correlations between allele frequency fluctuations at different loci. However, we show that these have negligible effects, at least for interactions among small numbers of loci. Our analyses are based on diffusion approximations that summarize the effects of drift in terms of F, the inbreeding coefficient, interpreted as the expected proportional decrease in heterozygosity at each locus. For haploids, the variance of the trait mean after a population bottleneck is var(Δz̄) =where n is the number of loci contributing to the trait variance, VA(1)=VA is the additive genetic variance, and VA(k) is the kth-order additive epistatic variance. The expected additive genetic variance after the bottleneck, denoted (V*A), is closely related to var(Δz̄); (V*A) (1 –F)Thus, epistasis inflates the expected additive variance above VA(1 –F), the expectation under additivity. For haploids (and diploids without dominance), the expected value of every variance component is inflated by the existence of higher order interactions (e.g., third-order epistasis inflates (V*AA)). This is not true in general with diploidy, because dominance alone can reduce (V*A) below VA(1 –F) (e.g., when dominant alleles are rare). Without dominance, diploidy produces simple expressions: var(Δz̄)==1 (2F) kVA(k) and (V*A) = (1 –F)k(2F)k-1VA(k) With dominance (and even without epistasis), var(Δz̄)and (V*A) no longer depend solely on the variance components in the base population. For small F, the expected additive variance simplifies to (V*A)(1 –F) VA+ 4FVAA+2FVD+2FCAD, where CAD is a sum of two terms describing covariances between additive effects and dominance and additive × dominance interactions. Whether population bottlenecks lead to expected increases in additive variance depends primarily on the ratio of nonadditive to additive genetic variance in the base population, but dominance precludes simple predictions based solely on variance components. We illustrate these results using a model in which genotypic values are drawn at random, allowing extreme and erratic epistatic interactions. Although our analyses clarify the conditions under which drift is expected to increase VA, we question the evolutionary importance of such increases.",

		"abstract": "Interaction between genes, or epistasis, is found to be common and it is a key concept for understanding adaptation and evolution of natural populations, response to selection in breeding programs, and determination of complex disease. Currently, two independent classes of models are used to study epistasis. Statistical models focus on maintaining desired statistical properties for detection and estimation of genetic effects and for the decomposition of genetic variance using average effects of allele substitutions in populations as parameters. Functional models focus on the evolutionary consequences of the attributes of the genotype–phenotype map using natural effects of allele substitutions as parameters. Here we provide a new, general and unified model framework: the natural and orthogonal interactions (NOIA) model. NOIA implements tools for transforming genetic effects measured in one population to the ones of other populations (e.g., between two experimental designs for QTL) and parameters of statistical and functional epistasis into each other (thus enabling us to obtain functional estimates of QTL), as demonstrated numerically. We develop graphical interpretations of functional and statistical models as regressions of the genotypic values on the gene content, which illustrates the difference between the models—the constraint on the slope of the functional regression—and when the models are equivalent. Furthermore, we use our theoretical foundations to conceptually clarify functional and statistical epistasis, discuss the advantages of NOIA over previous theory, and stress the importance of linking functional and statistical models.",

		"abstract": "Studying the consequences of hybridization on plant performance is insightful to understand the adaptive potential of populations, notably at local scales. Due to reduced effective recombination, predominantly selfing species are organized in highly homozygous multi-locus-genotypes (or lines) that accumulate genetic differentiation both among- and within-populations. This high level of homozygosity facilitates the dissection of the genetic basis of hybrid performance in highly selfing species, which gives insights into the mechanisms of reproductive isolation between lines. Here, we explored the fitness consequences of hybridization events between natural inbred lines of the predominantly selfing species Medicago truncatula, at both within- and among-populations scales. We found that hybridization has opposite effects pending on studied fitness proxies, with dry mass showing heterosis, and seed production showing outbreeding depression. Although we found significant patterns of heterosis and outbreeding depression, they did not differ significantly for within- compared to among-population crosses. Family-based analyses allowed us to determine that hybrid differentiation was mostly due to dominance and epistasis. Dominance and/or dominant epistatic interactions increased dry mass, while decreasing seed production, and recessive epistatic interactions mostly had a positive effect on both fitness proxies. Our results illustrate how genetic incompatibilities can accumulate at a very local scale among multi-locus-genotypes, and how non-additive genetic effects contribute to heterosis and outbreeding depression.",

Characterizing the genomic composition of hybrids is critical for studies of hybrid zone dynamics, inheritance of traits, and consequences of hybridization for evolution and conservation. Hybrid genomes are often summarized either by an estimate of the proportion of alleles coming from each ancestral population or classification into discrete categories like F1, F2, backcross, or merely “hybrid” vs. “pure”. In most cases, it is not realistic to classify individuals into the restricted set of classes produced in the first two generations of admixture. However, the continuous ancestry index misses an important dimension of the genotype. Joint consideration of ancestry together with interclass heterozygosity (proportion of loci with alleles from both ancestral populations) captures all of the information in the discrete classification without the unrealistic assumption that only two generations of admixture have transpired.",

Using a set of near-isogenic lines (NILs) representing 85% of the genome of the wild species Lycopersicon hirsutum (Solanum habrochaites) in the genetic background of the cultivated tomato L. esculentum (S. lycopersicum), we found that hybrid pollen and seed infertility are each based on 5–11 QTL that individually reduce hybrid fitness by 36–90%. Seed infertility QTL act additively or recessively, consistent with findings in other systems where incompatibility loci have largely been recessive. Genetic lengths of introgressed chromosomal segments explain little of the variation for hybrid incompatibility among NILs, arguing against an infinitesimal model of hybrid incompatibility and reinforcing our inference of a limited number of discrete incompatibility factors between these species. In addition, male (pollen) and other (seed) incompatibility factors are roughly comparable in number. The latter two findings contrast strongly with data from Drosophila where hybrid incompatibility can be highly polygenic and complex, and male sterility evolves substantially faster than female sterility or hybrid inviability. The observed differences between Lycopersicon and Drosophila might be due to differences in sex determination system, reproductive and mating biology, and/or the prevalence of sexual interactions such as sexual selection.",

Crosses were conducted between 12 pairs of populations spanning a broad range of both geographic distance (5 m to 2007 km) and genetic distance (0.2% to 22.3% sequence divergence for a 606-bp segment of the mitochondrial COl gene). For each pair of populations, three fitness components (hatching number, survivorship number, and metamorphosis number) were measured in up to 16 cohorts including parentals, reciprocal F l> F2, F3, and first-generation backcross hybrids. Comparisons of each set of cohorts allowed estimation of within- and between-locus gene interaction. Relative to parentals, F 1 hybrids showed a trend toward increased fitness, with no correspondence with population divergence, and a decrease in variance, which in some cases correlated with population divergence. In sharp contrast, F2 hybrids had a decrease in fitness and an increase in variance that both corresponded to population divergence. Genetic interpretation of these patterns suggests that both the beneficial effects of dominance and the detrimental effects of breaking up coadaptation are magnified by increasing evolutionary distance between populations. Because there is no recombination in T. californicus females, effects of recombination can be assessed by comparing F1 hybrid males and females backcrossed to parentals. Both recombinant and nonrecombinant backcross hybrids showed a decline in fitness correlated with population divergence, indicating that segregation among chromosomes contributes to the breakup of coadaptation. Although there was no difference in mean fitness between the two backcross types, recombinational backcrosses showed greater variance for fitness than nonrecombinational backcrosses, suggesting that the breakup of parental gene ombinations within chromosomes has both beneficial and detrimental effects.",

		"abstract": "Understanding the phenotypic and genetic architecture of reproductive isolation is a long-standing goal of speciation research. In several systems, large-effect loci contributing to barrier phenotypes have been characterized, but such causal connections are rarely known for more complex genetic architectures. In this study, we combine “top-down” and “bottom-up” approaches with demographic modelling toward an integrated understanding of speciation across a monkeyflower hybrid zone. Previous work suggests that pollinator visitation acts as a primary barrier to gene flow between two divergent red- and yellow-flowered ecotypes of Mimulus aurantiacus. Several candidate isolating traits and anonymous single nucleotide polymorphism loci under divergent selection have been identified, but their genomic positions remain unknown. Here, we report findings from demographic analyses that indicate this hybrid zone formed by secondary contact, but that subsequent gene flow was restricted by widespread barrier loci across the genome. Using a novel, geographic cline-based genome scan, we demonstrate that candidate barrier loci are broadly distributed across the genome, rather than mapping to one or a few “islands of speciation.” Quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping reveals that most floral traits are highly polygenic, with little evidence that QTL colocalize, indicating that most traits are genetically independent. Finally, we find little evidence that QTL and candidate barrier loci overlap, suggesting that some loci contribute to other forms of reproductive isolation. Our findings highlight the challenges of understanding the genetic architecture of reproductive isolation and reveal that barriers to gene flow other than pollinator isolation may play an important role in this system.",

		"abstract": "New species form when they become reproductively isolated. A classic model of speciation posits that derived mutations appear in isolated populations and reduce fitness when combined in hybrids. While these Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibilities are known to accumulate as populations diverge over time, they may also reflect the amount of standing genetic variation within populations. We analysed the fitness of F2 hybrids in crosses between 24 populations of a plant species (Campanula americana) with broad variation in standing genetic variation and genetic differentiation driven by post-glacial range expansions. Hybrid breakdown varied substantially and was strongest between populations near the historical cores of the species range where within-population genetic diversity was high. Nearly half of the variation in hybrid breakdown was predicted by the combined effects of standing genetic variation within populations, their pairwise genetic differentiation and differences in the climates they inhabit. Hybrid breakdown was enhanced between populations inhabiting distinct climates, likely reflecting local adaptation. Results support that the mutations causing hybrid breakdown, the raw material for speciation, are more common in long-inhabited areas of the species range. Genetic diversity harboured in refugial areas is thus an important source of incompatibilities critical to the speciation process.",

		"abstract": "Genomes sampled from hybrid zones between nascent species provide important clues into the speciation process. With advances in genome sequencing and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping, it is now feasible to measure variation in gene flow with high genomic resolution. This progress motivates the development of conceptual and analytical frameworks for hybrid zones that complement well-established cline approaches. We extend the perspective that genomic distributions of ancestry are sensitive indicators of hybridization history. We use simulations to examine the behavior of the number of ancestry junctions—a simple summary of genomic patterns—in hybrid zones under increasingly realistic scenarios. Neutral simulations revealed that ancestry junction number is shaped by population structure, migration rate, and population size. Modeling multiple genetic architectures of hybrid dysfunction, with an emphasis on epistatic hybrid incompatibilities, showed that selection reduces junction number near loci that confer reproductive barriers. The magnitude of this signature was affected by the form of selection, dominance, and genomic location (autosome vs. sex chromosome) of incompatible loci. Our results suggest that researchers can identify loci involved in reproductive isolation by scanning hybrid genomes for local reductions in junction number. We outline necessary directions for future theory and method development to realize this goal.",

		"abstract": "The joint effects of linkage and epistasis (interaction between non-allelic genes in determining fitness) have been examined for two-locus polymorphisms. The general results are of the following nature: (1) Gene frequencies change toward a stable equilibrium condition which corresponds to a local maximum in mean adaptive value. This change occurs in such a way that the rate of increase of mean adaptive value is not maximum. That is, the trajectory of gene frequency changes is not the \"steepest path\" on the adaptive surface. (2) In the absence of epistasis, linkage does not affect the final equilibrium of the population. (3) When epistasis is present, linkage must be fairly tight in order for there to be any effect on the final equilibrium. The amount of recombination allowed for such cases is, in general, a function of epistatic deviations. (4) If linkage is tighter than the value demanded by the magnitude of epistatic deviations, there may be permanent linkage disequilibrium of considerable magnitude, and the gene frequencies may also be affected. (5) There are some cases where a stable equilibrium is possible only with a tight linkage. Without such linkage complication, there will be no intermediate gene frequency stable equilibrium. (6) The approach to the equilibrium condition is affected by linkage irrespective of whether there is epistasis although the effect is greater when epistasis is present.",

		"abstract": "As has been pointed out by various authors, frequency of recombination within a chromosome is subject to selective adjustment. In this sense, the history of the control of recombination may be regarded as a part of the history of the evolution of genetic system. In 1930 Fisher said that with two pairs of linked loci such that A1 is favored in the presence of B1 while A2 is favored with B2 selection will act in such a way as to decrease the amount of recombination between the two loci. He did not, however, specify how a stable polymorphism of this type might be maintained. In this paper a model suggested by Sheppard is examined. It is shown that, if the first locus is maintained in balanced polymorphism by heterozygote superiority in fitness, the second locus will remain polymorphic if linkage is sufficiently close. Under this condition an inversion (or other crossover reducing mechanism) will be favored by selection and, other things being equal, will eventually be established in the population.",

		"abstract": "Recent genomic studies have highlighted the important role of admixture in shaping genome-wide patterns of diversity. Past admixture leaves a population genomic signature of linkage disequilibrium (LD), reﬂecting the mixing of parental chromosomes by segregation and recombination. These patterns of LD can be used to infer the timing of admixture, but the results of inference can depend strongly on the assumed demographic model. Here, we introduce a theoretical framework for modeling patterns of LD in a geographic contact zone where two differentiated populations have come into contact and are mixing by diffusive local migration. Assuming that this secondary contact is recent enough that genetic drift can be ignored, we derive expressions for the expected LD and admixture tract lengths across geographic space as a function of the age of the contact zone and the dispersal distance of individuals. We develop an approach to infer age of contact zones, using population genomic data from multiple spatially sampled populations by ﬁtting our model to the decay of LD with recombination distance. To demonstrate an application of our model, we use our approach to explore the ﬁt of a geographic contact zone model to three human genomic data sets from populations in Indonesia, Central Asia, and India and compare our results to inference under different demographic models. We obtain substantially different results from those of the commonly used model of panmictic admixture, highlighting the sensitivity of admixture timing results to the choice of demographic model.",
